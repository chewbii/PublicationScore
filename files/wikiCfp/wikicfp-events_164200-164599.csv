SUI will be held December 1-2, 2022 (virtually). We seek original, unpublished papers documenting research contributions, practice and experience, or systems and novel applications, from all areas of spatial user interaction. User interface evaluations are strongly encouraged for every publication in this venue. Specific topics of interest include:\rSpatial interaction techniques\rSpatial user interface metaphors\rSpatial input devices and technology\rInteraction in mixed, augmented, and virtual reality\rEvaluation methods for spatial user interaction\rCollaborative interaction in 3D space\rDesign and user experience (UX) for spatial user interaction\rApplications of human spatial perception to interaction\rAdaptive and perceptual-inspired spatial user interaction\rApplications of spatial UIs, such as games, entertainment, CAD, education\rGesture-based spatial interaction\rTangible spatial user interaction\rMulti-touch technologies for spatial user interaction\rDesktop interfaces for spatial interaction\rMultisensory and other novel forms of spatial user interaction\rSystem Contributions - We invite many types of research contributions, including interactive systems. However, evaluating systems that are built using existing techniques can be difficult. For example, a system can be built using a known machine learning technique but it can enable entirely new functionality. In this case, reviewers will need to judge the novelty of the new functionality that the system enables without penalizing the work for leveraging an existing technique. For reference, here\xe2\x80\x99s a paper about evaluating interactive systems that reviewers and authors may want to familiarize themselves with: James Fogarty (2017): Code and Contribution in Interactive Systems Research (https://homes.cs.washington.edu/~jfogarty/publications/workshop-chi2017-codeandcontribution.pdf)\r Important Dates\r All deadlines are 23:59 AoE.\rSubmission deadline: 8 August 2022\rNotification: 21 September 2022 \rCamera Ready: 14 October 2022\r Submission Instructions\r The symposium invites full and short paper submissions. Papers are of variable length, which should match the level of detail of description for the research contribution.\rFull papers (normally 8 pages, maximum 10; excluding references) should describe research or design work within the scope of spatial user interaction.\rShort papers (up to 4 pages; excluding references) should address the same topic, but may include preliminary results or conceptual ideas.\rFor submission, please follow these instructions:\rSubmissions must not be previously published or accepted for publication elsewhere and must not be under review by any other publication venue during SUI 2022\xe2\x80\x99s reviewing period. Double submissions will be desk-rejected without review. In doubt, contact the program chairs or include a properly anonymized version of the competitive manuscript as supplementary materials.\r All submissions should be prepared in the ACM SIG Proceedings format (https://www.acm.org/publications/proceedings-template). For the Latex version, please use the sigconf template. We accept submissions in either dual-column or single-column ACM format; the page limits above are stated in dual-column format.\r Submitted papers must be anonymous for the double blind reviewing process. We strongly encourage you to not anonymize citations to your own works. These should not be omitted, but referenced in 3rd person. For example, you can write ""In a study by Jones et al. [1]..."" and reference your own paper, instead of ""In my previous work [1]..."", with the reference listed as ""[1] Blank for review.""\r Highly relevant references to accepted, but still unavailable (i.e., ""in press"") publications may be used, but should be included with author\xe2\x80\x99s permission as supplementary materials. These also must be anonymized!\r Submissions must be made through the online submission system. Please specify the following submission options:\rSociety: SIGCHI, Conference/Journal: SUI 2022, Track: SUI 2022 Papers\r(https://new.precisionconference.com/sui21a/)\r When designing and presenting user evaluations, please consider the following:\rUser interface evaluations using non-representative or homogeneous participant populations can lead to biased results and inaccurate conclusions.\r When performing user experiments, researchers should strive to use samples that are representative of the population for which the technology is being designed.\rIf non-representative samples are not possible to collect, the limitations of the population studied should be clearly discussed within the paper. \rIf non-representative samples are not possible to collect, care must be taken when making claims about the work.\r When reporting on user studies participant demographic information must be included so that future researchers understand the results based on the population studied. \r Publication\r Accepted work will be archived in the ACM Digital Library, and will be provided as open-access for the first month following the symposium. Please note that at least one author of each accepted submission will be required to register to present at the symposium. If no author is registered by the early registration deadline, the accepted work will be withdrawn from the proceedings and digital libraries.\r Please be informed of the following messages from ACM:\rBy submitting your article to an ACM Publication, you are hereby acknowledging that you and your co-authors are subject to all ACM Publications Policies, including ACM\'s new Publications Policy on Research Involving Human Participants and Subjects. Alleged violations of this policy or any ACM Publications Policy will be investigated by ACM and may result in a full retraction of your paper, in addition to other potential penalties, as per ACM Publications Policy.\r Please ensure that you and your co-authors obtain an ORCID ID, so you can complete the publishing process for your accepted paper. ACM has been involved in ORCID from the start and we have recently made a commitment to collect ORCID IDs from all of our published authors. The collection process has started and will roll out as a requirement throughout 2022. We are committed to improve author discoverability, ensure proper attribution and contribute to ongoing community efforts around name normalization; your ORCID ID will help in these efforts.\r Please visit https://sui.acm.org for the most up-to-date submission instructions and deadlines.\r Contact:\r Questions should be directed to the SUI 2022 Program Chair through email: \rprogram@sui.acm.org\rTabitha Peck, Davidson College, USA\rThammathip Piumsomboon, University of Canterbury, New Zealand\rBenjamin Weyers, University of Trier, Germany\rBest regards,\rTabitha, Tham, and Benni\r    \n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166563"">ACM ICHMI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 3rd International Conference on Human\xe2\x80\x93Machine Interaction (ICHMI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166564"">ICHMI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 3rd International Conference on Human\xe2\x80\x93Machine Interaction (ICHMI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166668"">PLDI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 44th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158633"">ACM--ICAIP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2022 6th International Conference on Advances in Image Processing (ICAIP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166667"">ESEC/FSE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167734"">ACM ESCC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 European Symposium on Computer and Communications (ESCC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166671"">SIGMETRICS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 2023 ACM SIGMETRICS (Winter Deadline)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163009"">IMIP 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 5th International Conference on Intelligent Medicine and Image Processing (IMIP 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165909"">ACM ICIIT 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 8th International Conference on Intelligent Information Technology (ICIIT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167735"">ESCC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 European Symposium on Computer and Communications (ESCC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Abstract and\rsubmission deadlines are strict and there will be no extensions.\r DISTINGUISHED PAPER AWARDS\r Around 10% of the accepted papers at CPP 2023 will be designated as\rDistinguished Papers. This award highlights papers that the CPP program\rcommittee thinks should be read by a broad audience due to their relevance,\roriginality, significance and clarity.\r TOPICS OF INTEREST\r We welcome submissions in research areas related to formal certification of\rprograms and proofs. The following is a non-exhaustive list of topics of\rinterest to CPP:\r * certified or certifying programming, compilation, linking, OS kernels, runtime\r  systems, security monitors, and hardware;\r* certified mathematical libraries and mathematical theorems;\r* proof assistants (e.g, ACL2, Agda, Coq, Dafny, F*, HOL4, HOL Light, Idris,\r  Isabelle, Lean, Mizar, Nuprl, PVS, etc);\r* new languages and tools for certified programming;\r* program analysis, program verification, and program synthesis;\r* program logics, type systems, and semantics for certified code;\r* logics for certifying concurrent and distributed systems;\r* mechanized metatheory, formalized programming language semantics, and logical\r  frameworks;\r* higher-order logics, dependent type theory, proof theory, logical systems,\r  separation logics, and logics for security;\r* verification of correctness and security properties;\r* formally verified blockchains and smart contracts;\r* certificates for decision procedures, including linear algebra, polynomial\r  systems, SAT, SMT, and unification in algebras of interest;\r* certificates for semi-decision procedures, including equality, first-order\r  logic, and higher-order unification;\r* certificates for program termination;\r* formal models of computation;\r* mechanized (un)decidability and computational complexity proofs;\r* formally certified methods for induction and coinduction;\r* integration of interactive and automated provers;\r* logical foundations of proof assistants;\r* applications of AI and machine learning to formal certification;\r* user interfaces for proof assistants and theorem provers;\r* teaching mathematics and computer science with proof assistants.\r SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\r Prior to the paper submission deadline, the authors should upload their\ranonymized paper in PDF format through the HotCRP system at\r https://cpp2023.hotcrp.com\r The submissions must be written in English and provide sufficient detail to\rallow the program committee to assess the merits of the contribution. They must\rbe formatted following the ACM SIGPLAN Proceedings format using the acmart style\rwith the sigplan option, which provides a two-column style, using 10 point font\rfor the main text, and a header for double blind review submission, i.e.,\r \\documentclass[sigplan,10pt,anonymous,review]{acmart}\\settopmatter{printfolios=true,printccs=false,printacmref=false}\r The submitted papers should not exceed 12 pages, including tables and figures,\rbut excluding bibliography and clearly marked appendices. The papers should be\rself-contained without the appendices. Shorter papers are welcome and will be\rgiven equal consideration. Submissions not conforming to the requirements\rconcerning format and maximum length may be rejected without further\rconsideration.\r CPP 2023 will employ a lightweight double-blind reviewing process following the\rprocess from previous years. To facilitate this, the submissions must adhere to\rtwo rules:\r(1) author names and institutions must be omitted, and\r(2) references to authors\xe2\x80\x99 own related work should be in the third person (e.g.,\r    not ""We build on our previous work ..."" but rather ""We build on the work of\r    ..."").\r The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an\rinitial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for\rthem to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the\rname of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing it\rmore difficult. In particular, important background references should not be\romitted or anonymized. In addition, authors are free to disseminate their ideas\ror draft versions of their papers as usual. For example, authors may post drafts\rof their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Note that POPL\r2023 itself will employ full double-blind reviewing, which differs from the\rlight-weight CPP process.  This FAQ from previous SIGPLAN conference addresses\rmany common concerns:\rhttps://popl20.sigplan.org/track/POPL-2020-Research-Papers#Submission-and-Reviewing-FAQ\r We strongly encourage the authors to provide any supplementary material that\rsupports the claims made in the paper, such as proof scripts or experimental\rdata. This material must be uploaded at submission time, as an archive, not via\ra URL. Two forms of supplementary material may be submitted:\r (1) Anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers before\rthey submit their first-draft reviews.\r (2) Non-anonymous supplementary material is made available to the reviewers\rafter they have submitted their first-draft reviews and have learned the\ridentity of the authors.\r Please use anonymous supplementary material whenever possible, so that it can be\rtaken into account from the beginning of the reviewing process.\r The submitted papers must adhere to the SIGPLAN Republication Policy\r(https://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Republication/) and the ACM Policy\ron Plagiarism (https://www.acm.org/publications/policies/plagiarism). Concurrent\rsubmissions to other conferences, journals, workshops with proceedings, or\rsimilar forums of publication are not allowed. The PC chairs should be informed\rof closely related work submitted to a conference or journal in advance of\rsubmission. One author of each accepted paper is expected to present it at the\r(possibly virtual) conference.\r PUBLICATION, COPYRIGHT AND OPEN ACCESS\r The CPP 2023 proceedings will be published by the ACM, and authors of accepted\rpapers will be required to choose one of the following publication options:\r (1) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM a non-exclusive\r    permission-to-publish license and, optionally, licenses the work under a\r    Creative Commons license.\r (2) Author retains copyright of the work and grants ACM an exclusive\r    permission-to-publish license.\r (3) Author transfers copyright of the work to ACM.\r  For authors who can afford it, we recommend option (1), which will make the\rpaper Gold Open Access, and also encourage such authors to license their work\runder the CC-BY license. ACM will charge you an article processing fee for this\roption (currently, US$700), which you have to pay directly with the ACM.\r For everyone else, we recommend option (2), which is free and allows you to\rachieve Green Open Access, by uploading a preprint of your paper to a repository\rthat guarantees permanent archival such as arXiv or HAL. This is anyway a good\ridea for timely dissemination even if you chose option 1.\r The official CPP 2023 proceedings will also be available via SIGPLAN OpenTOC\r(http://www.sigplan.org/OpenTOC/#cpp).\r For ACM\xe2\x80\x99s take on this, see their Copyright Policy\r(http://www.acm.org/publications/policies/copyright-policy) and Author Rights\r(http://authors.acm.org/main.html).\r PROGRAM COMMITTEE\r Steve Zdancewic, University of Pennsylvania, USA (co-chair)\rBrigitte Peintka, McGill University, Canada (co-chair)\rReynald Affeldt, AIST, Japan\rTej Chajed, MIT, USA\rKoen Claessen, Chalmers, Sweden\rRanald Clouston, ANU, Australia\rLeonardo de Moura, Microsoft Research, USA\rXinyu Feng, Nanjing University, China\rDenis Firsov, Tallinn University/GuardTime, Estonia\rYannick Forster, Inria Nantes, France\rMilos Gligoric, UT Austin, USA\rStephane Graham-Lengrand, SRI, USA\rElsa Gunter, Univerisity of Illinois Urbana-Champaign, USA\rChris Hawblitzel, Microsoft Research, US\rChantal Keller , Universit\xc3\xa9 Paris Saclay, France\rMarie Kerjean, CNRS, France\rYoonseung Kim, Seoul National University, Korea\rKenji Maillard, INRIA, France\rC\xc3\xa9sar Mu\xc3\xb1oz, Amazon Web Services, USA\rLawrence Paulson, Cambridge, UK\rPierre-Marie P\xc3\xa9drot, INRIA, France\rAnja Petkovi\xc4\x87 Komel, TU Wien, Vienna\rCl\xc3\xa9ment Pit-Claudel, EPFL, France\rChristine Rizkallah, University of Melbourne, Australia\rCody Roux, AWS, USA\rKazuhiko Sakaguchi, University of Tsukuba, Japan\rAnna Slobodova, Intel, USA\rAaron Stump, University of Iowa, US\rRen\xc3\xa9 Thiemann, University of Innsbruck, Austria\rAmin Timany, Aarhus University, Denmark\rJosef Urban, CIIRC (Prague), Czech Republic\rViktor Vafeiadis, MPI-SWS, Germany\rYuting Wang, Shanghai Jiao Tong University, China\rTjark Weber, Uppsala University, Sweden\r ORGANIZERS\r Dmitriy Traytel, University of Copenhagen, Denmark (conference co-chair)\rRobbert Krebbers, Radboud University, Netherlands (conference co-chair)\rBrigitte Peintka, McGill University, Canada (PC co-chair)\rSteve Zdancewic, University of Pennsylvania, United States (PC co-chair)\r CONTACT\r For any questions please contact the two PC chairs:\rSteve Zdancewic (stevez@seas.upenn.edu)\rBrigitte Pientka (bpientka@cs.mcgill.ca)\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=143507"">CPP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCertified Programs and Proofs (CPP) 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160339"">IEEE DApps - ZKP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE DApps -  Special Session \xe2\x80\x9cVerifiable Off-Chain Computations using Zero-Knowledge Proofs \xe2\x80\x93 A DApp Perspective\xe2\x80\x9d\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163869"">PROOFS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n11th International Workshop on Security Proofs for Embedded Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153590"">Paneled Scaffolding 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPaneled Scaffolding: Reflecting on Building and Sustaining Comics Studies Programs, Library Collections, and Journals\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156519"">CMPB_ASIT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nComputer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine special issue on Image Analysis in Advanced Skin Imaging Technology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158896"">SCULPT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nShape Creation Using Layouts, Programs, &amp; Technology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153377"">CMPB_ASIT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nComputer Methods and Programs in Biomedicine special issue on Image Analysis in Advanced Skin Imaging Technology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=151202"">EuroPLoP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n25th European Conference on Pattern Languages of Programs (EuroPLoP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155870"">TAP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nTests and Proofs\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165135"">CPMAICertification 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nGet CPMAI Certified: Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) Methodology Training and Certification\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

The conference spans the spectrum from purely static to fully dynamic approaches, and from pure software-based methods to specific architectural features and support for code generation and optimization.\r IMPORTANT DATES\r Paper Submission: September 2, 2022\rAuthor Rebuttal Period: October 26 - October 28, 2022\rPaper Notification: November 7, 2022\rArtifact Evaluation Deadline: November 28, 2022\rArtifact Evaluation Notification: December 20, 2022\r  TOPICS\r Original contributions are solicited on, but not limited to, the following topics:\r * Code Generation, Translation, Transformation, and Optimization for performance, energy, virtualization, portability, security, or reliability concerns, and architectural support\r* Efficient execution of dynamically typed and higher-level languages\r* Optimization and code generation for emerging programming models, platforms, domain-specific languages\r* Dynamic/static, profile-guided, feedback-directed, and machine learning based optimization\r* Static, Dynamic, and Hybrid Analysis for performance, energy, memory locality, throughput or latency, security, reliability, or functional debugging\r* Program characterization methods\r* Efficient profiling and instrumentation techniques; architectural support\r* Novel and efficient tools\r* Compiler design, practice and experience\r* Compiler abstraction and intermediate representations\r* Vertical integration of language features, representations, optimizations, and runtime support for parallelism\r* Solutions that involve cross-layer (HW/OS/VM/SW) design and integration\r* Deployed dynamic/static compiler and runtime systems for general purpose, embedded system and Cloud/HPC platforms\r* Parallelism, heterogeneity, and reconfigurable architectures\r* Optimizations for heterogeneous or specialized targets, GPUs, SoCs, CGRA\r* Compiler support for vectorization, thread extraction, task scheduling, speculation, transaction, memory management, data distribution and synchronization\r  CALL FOR TOOL AND PRACTICAL EXPERIENCE PAPERS\r In recent years CGO had a special category of papers called \xe2\x80\x9cTools and Practical Experience,\xe2\x80\x9d which was very successful. CGO this year will have the same category of papers. Such a paper is subject to the same page length guidelines, except that it must give a clear account of its functionality and a summary about the practice experience with realistic case studies, and describe all the supporting artifacts available.\r For papers submitted in this category that present a tool, it is mandatory to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process and to be successfully evaluated. These papers will initially be conditionally accepted based on the condition that an artifact is submitted to the Artifact Evaluation process and that this artifact is successfully evaluated. Authors are not required to make their tool publicly available, but we do require that an artifact is submitted and successfully evaluated.\r Papers submitted in this category presenting practical experience are encouraged but not required to submit an artifact to the Artifact Evaluation process.\r The selection criteria for papers in this category are:\r* Originality: Papers should present CGO-related technologies applied to real-world problems with scope or characteristics that set them apart from previous solutions.\r* Usability: The presented Tools or compilers should have broad usage or applicability. They are expected to assist in CGO-related research, or could be extended to investigate or demonstrate new technologies. If significant components are not yet implemented, the paper will not be considered.\r* Documentation: The tool or compiler should be presented on a web-site giving documentation and further information about the tool.\r* Benchmark Repository: A suite of benchmarks for testing should be provided.\r* Availability: Preferences will be given to tools or compilers that are freely available (at either the source or binary level). Exceptions may be made for industry and commercial tools that cannot be made publicly available for business reasons.\r* Foundations: Papers should incorporate the principles underpinning Code Generation and Optimization (CGO). However, a thorough discussion of theoretical foundations is not required; a summary of such should suffice.\r* Artifact Evaluation: The submitted artifact must be functional and supports the claims made in the paper. Submission of an artifact is mandatory for papers presenting a tool.\r  ARTIFACT EVALUATION\r The Artifact Evaluation process is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. This process contributes to improved reproducibility in research that should be a great concern to all of us. There is also some evidence that papers with a supporting artifact receive higher citations than papers without (Artifact Evaluation: Is It a Real Incentive? by B. Childers and P. Chrysanthis).\r Authors of accepted papers at CGO have the option of submitting their artifacts for evaluation within two weeks of paper acceptance. To ease the organization of the AE committee, we kindly ask authors to indicate at the time they submit the paper, whether they are interested in submitting an artifact. Papers that go through the Artifact Evaluation process successfully will receive a seal of approval printed on the papers themselves. Additional information is available on the CGO AE web page. Authors of accepted papers are encouraged, but not required, to make these materials publicly available upon publication of the proceedings, by including them as \xe2\x80\x9csource materials\xe2\x80\x9d in the ACM Digital Library.\r Authors should carefully consider the difference in focus with the co-located conferences when deciding where to submit a paper. CGO will make the proceedings freely available via the ACM DL platform during the period from two weeks before to two weeks after the conference. This option will facilitate easy access to the proceedings by conference attendees, and it will also enable the community at large to experience the excitement of learning about the latest developments being presented in the period surrounding the event itself.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=135196"">CGO 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE/ACM International Symposium on Code Generation and Optimization\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146828"">NLPTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on NLP Techniques and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167722"">CloudCom 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 13th IEEE International Conference on Cloud Computing Technology and Science\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=115414"">ACM-EI/Scopus-ACAI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 5th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166999"">COCOA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 16th Annual International Conference on Combinatorial Optimization and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165754"">Distributed ML and Opt. 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDistributed Machine Learning and Optimization: Theory and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=121887"">IOP, EI, Scopus-PRECE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Power, Renewable Energy and Control Engineering (PRECE 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154598"">INLG 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n15th International Natural Language Generation Conference\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163146"">ICICO 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Conference on Intelligent Computing &amp; Optimization 2022\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

In fact, they ever more represent the core of most CE products, and they are also changing the way these products are designed and engineered. As a matter of example, on the one side, AI, ML and DL support the most advanced audio/video systems and their embedded signal processing functionalities, or enable the necessary information handling required in any smart environment powered by Internet of Thing (IoT) and edge computing paradigms. On the other hand, modern solutions for security and privacy, automotive and next-generation vehicles, or entertainment, among others, strongly rely on AI, ML and DL since from their early conception and, afterwards, in any development step. Therefore, this Special Section of the IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics (TCE) will focus on innovative methods that have successfully showed the benefits of exploiting AI, ML, and DL with CE systems throughout their entire lifecycle. \r Topics of interest in this Special Section include (but are not limited to) AI, ML, and DL technologies used in designing, developing, and powering state-of-the-art:\r * Audio/video systems and signal processing solutions\r* CE for automotive and next-generation vehicles\r* Consumer systems for healthcare and wellbeing\r* IoT, Internet of Everywhere, edge computing and smart environments  \r* Quantum-supported CE \r* Security and privacy mechanisms for hardware and software CE systems\r* Extended reality (VR/AR/MR), HMI, entertainment and gaming \r Important dates\r * Submission of Manuscripts: 15 SEPTEMBER 2022\r* Notification to Authors (1st Revision): 15 NOVEMBER 2022\r* Submission of Revised Manuscripts: 15 DECEMBER 2022\r* Notification to Authors (2nd Revision): 15 JANUARY 2023\r* Final Versions Due: 31 JANUARY 2023\r* Publication scheduled on: Issues 1-2 of 2023\r Senior and Guest Editors\r * Fabrizio Lamberti, Politecnico di Torino, Italy (Senior Editor of IEEE TCE)\r* Alberto Cannav\xc3\xb2, Politecnico di Torino, Italy\r* Zaixing He, Zhejiang University, China\r* Lucia Pepa, Universit\xc3\xa0 Politecnica delle Marche, Italy\r* Chia-Mu Yu, National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Taiwan\r Instructions for authors \r Manuscripts must be submitted online via ScholarOne Manuscript Central following the IEEE Transactions on Consumer Electronics instructions: https://ctsoc.ieee.org/publications/ieee-transactions-on-consumer-electronics.html\r During submission, the Special Section on Consumer Electronics Designed with Artificial Intelligence \xe2\x80\x93 Part I should be selected.

These systems exist everywhere around us, and range in size, complexity and criticality, from embedded systems used in smart vehicles, to SCADA systems in smart grids to control systems in water distribution systems, to smart transportation systems, to plant control systems, engineering workstations, substation equipment, programmable logic controllers (PLCs), and other Industrial Control Systems (ICS). These systems also include the emerging trend of Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) that will be the central part of the fourth industrial revolution.\r As ICS and CPS proliferate, and increasingly interact with us and affect our life, their security becomes of paramount importance.

Agile and iterative approaches have become adopted best practices for application development projects, but why don\xe2\x80\x99t we have something similar when it comes to advanced analytics, big data, and AI projects? Without using best-practices approaches that standardize steps for data preparation, data identification, and data protection, it\xe2\x80\x99s hard to achieve the success you\xe2\x80\x99re expecting, wasting money and resources, leading to failure.\r This session will walk through the Cognitive Project Management for AI (CPMAI) methodology to provide the foundation needed for project success, especially as you incorporate advanced analytics and AI projects. The CPMAI methodology is the established best practice for AI & ML projects, and increasingly will be demanded by organizations and agencies that plan to develop, procure, and deliver AI and advanced analytics projects. This session will provide real world examples of how CPMAI methodology allows individuals to gain the skills needed for AI project success.\r Be sure to stick around for Q&A at the end!

However, with all this interest and hype in AI, only a small percentage of AI projects are actually seeing success. Why are so many AI projects failing when they don\xe2\x80\x99t need to? With all the resources, great technology, and skilled talent put towards building AI projects, we shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t be seeing so much AI project failure, but up to 80% of AI projects are not being completed successfully or achieving critical success measures. Clearly it\xe2\x80\x99s not a technology or people problem, so what could be the main issues holding back AI project success?\r Leveraging experience with thousands of AI projects and experience through best-practices approaches to AI, Cognilytica shares in this webinar the most common reasons for AI project failures and the insights to be learned from those failures. In this webinar we will discuss common reasons we see AI projects fail, the risk of overpromising and underdelivering on AI capabilities, methodologies and processes that can guarantee a higher rate of success, and how to avoid the common traps and pitfalls that usually beset AI projects.\r Be sure to stick around for Q&A at the end!

A chess program, speech recognition, an algorithm to rapidly buy and sell financial products. These are straightforward applications of structured data problems. One of the chief difficulties is in getting understanding in the enterprise beyond these structured data cases, particularly in the domain of limited budgets. Once the \xe2\x80\x9cfirst generation AI\xe2\x80\x9d is implemented, successfully or not, the next step is more lateral movement \xe2\x80\x93 development of more standalone cases, rather than layering and refactoring to produce additional complexity, the neural nets and deep learning AI problem sets. \r Join this interactive session to learn some of the difficulties associated with implementing AI as well as the difficulties moving from \xe2\x80\x9cfirst generation\xe2\x80\x9d to \xe2\x80\x9csecond generation\xe2\x80\x9d AI in order to achieve business process improvement by modifying data architecture to reflect how data is actually used.\r Be sure to stick around for Q&A with Dr. Roust!

A PDF or Word document should be submitted for all types of submissions. All submissions can be electronically uploaded to the EasyChair service: Click here to submit on EasyChair. (link for submission: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=sigite2022)\r Panel and workshop proposals should include author information, while all other submissions (papers, extended abstracts, and big ideas) should be anonymous, with all author information removed. Submissions must adhere to the page limits described below, and submissions that exceed the limits will be rejected without review. Authors must register for and attend the conference as specified below in order for their work to appear in the conference proceedings.\r The Conference Committee has elected to move to the single column ACM template increasingly used for journals and proceedings. It is simpler to manage and easier to read. Because the words on each page are not as dense as the two column format, the number of pages of papers and other documents has changed, but the word counts will remain the same. \r ACM Proceedings Single-Column Template:\r LaTeX (use \\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} in the sample-authordraft.tex file for single-column): https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/consolidated-tex-template/acmart-primary.zip \rOverleaf, for collaborative authoring (use \\documentclass[manuscript,review,anonymous]{acmart} for single-column): https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/acm-conference-proceedings-master-template/pnrfvrrdbfwt   \rMS Word: https://www.acm.org/binaries/content/assets/publications/taps/acm_submission_template.docx \rPoster Templates:\rWe recommend use of templates from the Center for Open Science found at https://osf.io/6ua4k/.\r Other Information\r PAPERS\rSubmissions will be no longer than ten pages and will undergo a blind peer reviewing process. Authors will have approximately 30 minutes for their presentation, including the question and answer period. Accepted papers must be presented by at least one author and will be published in the conference proceedings. In some circumstances remote presentations of accepted papers may be possible.\r This year, we have two tracks for the full paper submissions:\r Experience Track: This track accepts experience in IT educations, the topics include but not limited to: experience reports, teaching techniques, pedagogical tools, curriculum design, IT curriculum standards, and so forth.\rResearch Track: The papers in this track are expected to discuss and evaluate methods to improve IT educations, the topics include but not limited to: novel and effective teaching methods, evaluation of pedagogical approaches, teaching and learning models, informal learning, online or distance learning, studies about the engagement in ITE, issues of gender, diversity, and underrepresentation, educational data mining, technology-enhanced learning, and so forth.\rPANELS\rPanels allow experts to discuss a current topic of interest in information technology education or research. Panel organizers are responsible for selecting appropriate panelists to participate. A panel will normally have at most four panelists including the organizer. Panel submissions should include a list of panelists, their affiliations, a description of the topics, and a brief position statement from each panelist. All panelists are expected to attend the conference and participate in the panel. Panel proposals are limited to four pages and will be published in the conference proceedings.\r WORKSHOPS\rWorkshops allow presenters to provide a tutorial or hands-on exploration of a topic in which attendees are expected to actively participate. The workshop proposer is required to attend the conference. Workshop proposals are limited to four pages and will be published in the conference proceedings. Workshops are typically 90 minutes, however, you may specify that you would like your workshop to run for 2 back-to-back 90-minute sessions if desired.\r BIG IDEAS IN IT EDUCATION\rParticipants are invited to prepare big idea talks that present works that attempt to challenge traditional thinking and/or wherein authors are actively seeking feedback from the SIGITE community. Accepted talks will be presented in a session as a lightning talk where each author is given 10 minutes to present their big idea including feedback. In some circumstances remote presentations may be possible. Big idea talk proposals are limited to two pages. Accepted talks will be published in the conference proceedings.\r EXTENDED ABSTRACTS AND POSTERS\rManuscripts considered Work in Progress (WiP) can be submitted as an extended abstract not longer than four pages. Extended abstracts will be reviewed by the program committee for inclusion in the conference proceedings and will be presented as posters during the conference itself. We especially encourage submissions from MS and PhD students who would like feedback on their research efforts. Topics not yet mature enough to warrant a full paper may also be submitted for presentation as a poster.

In the years following the arrival of the Windrush, the output of women writers of colour in the UK, or Black British women writers, increased. Yet, recognition of this group was not as forthcoming as acclaim and acknowledgement rested largely on male writers. While the work of all immigrant writers in the UK\xe2\x80\x94particularly those texts that recount the lived experiences surrounding immigration\xe2\x80\x94is critical to literature studies, women writers have historically been isolated to the margins of the canon. Specifically, immigrant women writers in the UK in the post-Windrush years, with a few exceptions, seem to labour almost in silence. This collection proposes an examination of Black British women\xe2\x80\x99s writing, focusing on the years after 1970, addressing the female immigrant experience. Some authors of interest are Eintou Pearl Springer (Trinidad), Binta Breeze (Jamaica), June Henfrey (Barbados), Buchi Emecheta (Nigeria), Hannah Pool (Eritrea), Nadifa Mohamed (Somalia), and Irenosen Okojie (Nigeria). Essays addressing the work of women writers who are British born, second generation, such as Bernadine Evaristo, Patience Agbabi, Monica Ali, and Meera Syal, are also welcome.\r Some topics include, but are not limited to:\r \xe2\x80\xa2\tPost Windrush female immigrants in British society\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBlack British female bildungsroman\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBlack British female immigrants and the Welfare State\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tImmigration and motherhood\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tMarriage and family structure in a diaspora\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tHealthcare, NHIS, and immigrants\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tImmigrant employment opportunities (or lack thereof)\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tImmigration and education\r NB: This collection is under contract with Cambridge Scholars Publishing.\r Final Submission Requirements:\r Final essays should be between 5000-7000 words, follow Chicago Manual of Style, utilise British English spelling, scholarly based, and free of copyright restrictions (statement of support required).\r All chapters submitted should conform to the grammar and formatting guidelines provided by Cambridge Scholars Publishing, which can be viewed here: https://www.cambridgescholars.com/pages/forms-guidelines; \r Due dates are as follows:\r 300-word abstracts & 50-word author biography\t                September 1\rResponse\t\t\t\t\t\t\tSeptember 20\rFirst draft\t\t\t\t\t\t\tNovember 30\rFeedback\t\t\t\t\t\t\tDecember 30\rFinal draft\t\t\t\t\t\t\tFebruary 15\r Please submit all inquiries and documents to calexander@tuskegee.edu.\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158895"">GIRES BLV2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nBlack Lives Matter: Lessons from a Global Movement\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165683"">BMVC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 33rd British Machine Vision Conference\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164538"">Disrupting Norms in Supernatural Teen Se 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nBlack Witches &amp; Queer Ghosts: Disrupting Norms in Supernatural Teen Serials\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159344"">ReVIEWING BMC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Proposals: ReVIEWING Black Mountain College 13\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=151619"">AI Meets Cybersecurity 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Papers: AI Meets Cybersecurity from Journal of Intelligent Information Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166674"">Pulsed Resources 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPulsed Resources Impacts on Biological Processes: From Genes to Ecosystems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158041"">FutureCyberspace 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Future of Cyberspace: From Neutrality and Liberation towards Warfare and Control\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156925"">DOING@ADBIS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Workshop on Intelligent Data \xe2\x80\x93 From Data to Knowledge\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158543"">Feminist Spaces  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nFeminist Spaces Summer 2022 Call for Papers\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159189"">Dhaka Bangladesh 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Workshop Camp on Research and Writing Skills\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

However, unlike earlier developments, smart production will allow for high levels of automation, customization, productivity, and efficiency that have never been seen before. Within these ""smart factories"" all processes interoperate seamlessly based on big data. And as the complexity of the processes increases, the demands placed on the work to be performed increase significantly.\rAugmented, virtual and mixed reality technologies offer a wide range of capabilities to support workers in future factories and present information in more interactive ways than their two-dimensional counterparts. XR assistance systems promise to increase the workers\xe2\x80\x99 efficiency by providing the right information at the right moment. If well implemented, XR can provide valuable assistance in increasingly complexity production environments.\rAgainst this background, an increasing impact of production processes supported by XR systems is to be expected within the next years. XR will facilitate work processes and individualize the information required by employees, which is important in times of skill shortages, travel restrictions and social distancing, thus enabling less qualified employees to work in more highly qualified jobs. XR also provides assistance for the higher-skilled to support problem-solving tasks, networking, and documentation of experience. The optimization information visualization, product quality, and processes contributes to securing sustainable safeguarding of manufacturing locations and to creating attractive jobs. However, the implementation of XR applications in manufacturing needs a high user acceptance, which is important for the actual use of the technology in work processes.\rConnecting specialists from various related research areas (such as automation systems engineering, production planning, etc.), with experts from both vision-oriented computer science areas (such as computer graphics or information visualization), and experts from XR-oriented computer science areas, the XR-SPro workshop series aims to create an open environment for discussing and investigating novel XR solutions for smart production. This includes (among others) the usage of spatial computing approaches for real-time data visualization, XR-supported remote assistance and customizable training scenarios that mimic reality and let workers train from anywhere at their own pace. By encouraging synergies of interdisciplinary approaches, the workshop tackles different applications of XR in a smart production context from different angles and creates new knowledge in this research field. XR-SPro wants to account to the state-of-the-art research in smart production with different XR applications, to shape a common understanding, to compare systems and approaches and derive common paradigms, to develop useful and necessary methods and techniques, and to foster new ideas.\r Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tUse Cases and pilot applications\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tXR-supported remote assistance\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tXR training and onboarding scenarios\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tSpatial computing in industry\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tHardware/Software support for smart production applications of XR\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tGamified XR environments in industry\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tInterdisciplinary and intermedia approaches\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tUser Acceptance of smart production XR applications\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tReal-time XR visualization of sensor and process data\r\xe2\x97\x8f\tTactility and physicality of XR applications in smart production\r ==Deadlines & Dates==\rPaper Submission Deadline: July 4, 2022\rNotification of acceptance: August 8, 2022\rCamera-ready Deadline: August 29, 2022\rWorkshop day: October 17, 2022\r ==Contribution Formats==\rFollowing the last years, contributions are planned to be included and indexed in the IEEE digital library.\r1.\tResearch Papers (6-8 pages) Novel results in the field in the above-mentioned categories related to XR development.\r2.\tShort Papers (up to 4 pages) Preliminary results or work in progress.\r3.\tState of the Art Reports (6-8 pages) Surveys on the main results in this field, which will allow us to understand and compare achievements and approaches in tackling issues from the XR communities.\r Papers must be written in English and follow the IEEE Computer Society VGTC format for described at: https://tc.computer.org/vgtc/publications/conference/\r All papers and camera-ready versions have to be submitted electronically using the conference management tool found at the website: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=xrspro2022\r Submissions will be reviewed by at least 2 program committee members following a single-blind review process.

The density of sensing increases, as does the frequency and amount of data generation. Monolithic big data frameworks do not fit well into this scheme and moreover do not reflect well the distinct operational models and responsibilities due to conventional handling of credentials. At the same time, developer-accessible cloud DevOps frameworks are increasingly becoming a choice to run at edge nodes, leading to diverse IoT-edge/fog-cloud continuum models for programming and deployment.\r The CIFS workshop gathers researchers and innovators around the challenges of building and operating complex computing topologies and associated cloud architectures around the Internet of Things and Cyber-Physical Systems, bridging the digital world with our environment. It calls for research and experience reports, from the algorithm level to completed production systems, in order to advance the knowledge resulting from progress in overcoming the challenges. CIFS also welcomes data-centric studies, simulations, testbeds and similar helpful software solutions.\r This year, in the face of the increasing complexity and massive scale of things-to-cloud applications and deployments in the real world, CIFS particularly welcomes submissions focused on the cloud-native security and resilience aspects of such applications.\r Topics of Interest\r We solicit research papers (up to 6p) and technical industry reports (typically 3-6p) on the following topics:\r     IoT-fog-cloud pipelines, architectures and continuums in various domains, from industrial deployments to smart cities\r    Smartness, adaptivity, fluidity and dynamicity for processing sensed data\r    Computing paradigms: multi-cloud, fog, serverless, osmotic, continuum computing\r    Applications in digitalised health care, ecology, agriculture, urban planning and other fields\r    Secure cloud/fog computing concepts (homomorphic encryption, enclaves, hardware security modules, stealth computing, coded computing among others)\r    Long-term distributed messaging and data storage security and proof-of-ownership/provision/retrievability\r    End-to-end reliability and security concepts across IoT-fog-cloud continuums\r    Physical and digital security of IoT deployments, smart meters and other end devices\r    Privacy, scalability and economics considerations as well as trade-offs\r    Cross-border, cross-provider and cross-stack security issues\r    Human factors: simplicity and controllability of complex CPS and CPSoS\r    Security, identity management and multitenancy in clouds and continuums\r Submission Information\r Submitted papers should contain results or reports not already published or submitted elsewhere, in IEEE format. All papers will be peer-reviewed by at least three programme committee members. The evaluation will be based on originality, relevance of the problem to the workshop topics, technical strength, quality of results, and clarity of the presentation. The publication of the workshop proceeding with all accepted papers will be by the IEEE and will appear in the same or companion volume as the UCC 2022 and BDCAT 2022 conferences.

Current standard media applications fall short of this goal since acquisition and production technologies in the consumer applications do not capture/produce enough of the world\xe2\x80\x99s visual, audio, spatial, and temporal information to faithfully represent it. In the last years, however, the area of photorealistic media has seen a lot of activity, with new multimedia areas emerging, such as light fields, point clouds, ultra-high definition, high frame rate, high dynamic range imaging, and novel 3D audio and sound field technologies. The combination of these technologies can certainly contribute to pave the way for hyper-realistic media experience. But first, we have to overcome several technological challenges. It is worth pointing out that research in this area requires the use of big datasets, software tools, and powerful infrastructures. Among these, the availability of meaningful datasets, with a diverse and high-quality content, is of significant importance.\r The goal of this workshop is to engage experts and researchers on the synthesis of photorealistic images and/or virtual environments, particularly in the form of public datasets, software tools, or infrastructures, for multimedia research. Such public datasets, software tools, and infrastructures will lower entry barriers by enabling researchers that lack expensive hardware (e.g., complex camera systems, smart glasses, robots, autonomous vehicles) to simulate and create datasets representative of such hardware and various scenarios. Photorealistic image and environment synthesis can benefit multiple research areas in addition to multimedia systems, such as machine learning, robotics, computer vision, mixed reality, and virtual reality.\r TOPICS OF INTEREST\r We welcome novel and unpublished research contributions on the following topics (but not limited to):\r - Characteristics of indoor and outdoor environments for multimedia research\r- Hardware and software tools for generation/alteration/customization of photorealistic virtual environments\r- Camera motion and video editing techniques\r- Standardization of video resolution and content for dataset comparison and aggregation\r- Objective and subjective QoE metrics for multimedia streaming and consumption\r- Standardized human subjects\xe2\x80\x99 data collection in multimedia streaming experiments\r- Dataset curation and dissemination platforms and tools\r WORKSHOP CHAIRS\r Ravi Prakash, University of Texas at Dallas, USA\rMylene Farias.

The Knowledge Management for Law (KM4LAW) workshop intends to be a forum to focus on legal informatics from different perspectives.\rThe advanced developments in AI over recent years have meant that seemingly insurmountable problems in AI & Law are beginning to be addressed. Accordingly, it is necessary to identify the limits of automated systems and how such systems can handle the remaining unsolved intentional and unintentional ambiguities and conflicts that require legal interpretation. Therefore, research works on the limits and unexplored opportunities offered by AI for the representation of knowledge in the legal domain constitute worthwhile contributions for this workshop.\rTypical goals may include: classification of legal sources, legal design and legal ontologies, similarity among legal decisions and clustering, prediction and support during judicial decision making, legal interpretation support, identification of evolution of legal concepts and definitions over time, information extraction and classification, detection of linguistic phenomena and patterns in legal sources, multilingual alignments of concepts on domestic and international legal sources, identification of legal references and network analysis, analogical reasoning, and compliance checking.\r TOPICS OF INTEREST\r The workshop will look for original, high quality contributions that explore the following (non-exhaustive) list of topics:\r- Natural language processing techniques and systems for legal documents\r- Identification of legal semantic roles and extraction of named entities\r- Automated knowledge extraction from legal text corpora\r- Experimental results using and adapting NLP methods for legal data\r- Information retrieval and multimedia search for legal documents\r- Multilingual alignments, retrieval, extraction and analysis of legal sources\r- Linked data and knowledge graphs in the legal domain\r- Classification or clustering of law\r- Domain-Specific Visual Modeling Language (DSVML) and law\r- Legal ontologies, visual law, legal design, and correlated themes\r- (Multilingual) Thesauri, vocabularies, and taxonomies in the legal area\r- Entity Recognition and Disambiguation\r- Training and Using Embeddings for legal text\r- Computational models of argumentation for legal data\r- Knowledge Base Population\r- Question Answering, Dialogue and Discourse Analysis, Query Understanding\r- Link Analysis, Relation and Event Extraction\r- Combining Legal Text with Structured Data\r- Legal Text Summarization and Generation\r- Emerging applications in legal data & knowledge engineering\r SUBMISSION INSTRUCTIONS\r Authors are invited to submit original, previously unpublished research papers.\r Papers should be written in English, following the new CEUR-ART 1-column style.\rThe LaTeX files for the new CEURART style are available as Overleaf Template: https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-for-submissions-to-ceur-workshop-proceedings-ceur-ws-dot-org/hpvjjzhjxzjk\rTo download an offline version with the style files: http://ceur-ws.org/Vol-XXX/CEURART.zip (it also contains DOCX template files)\r All papers must be converted to PDF prior to electronic submission.\r We accept two kinds of contributions:\r- short paper must be between 5 to 9 pages long (excluding references)\r- regular paper must be at least 10 pages long (excluding references)\rAt least one author of each accepted paper must register and participate in the workshop.\r According to CEUR-WS policy, the papers will be published under a CC BY 4.0 license (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/deed.en) that will be included in an open-access post-proceedings volume of CEUR Workshop Proceedings (http://ceur-ws.org/), indexed by both Scopus and DBLP.\r We are planning a Journal Special Issue, we will provide new information shortly.\r Submissions should be made via the Easychair system through the following submission page: https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=km4law\r WORKSHOP ORGANIZERS (in alphabetical order)\r Davide Audrito, University of Bologna (Italy)\rLuigi Di Caro,  University of Turin (Italy)\rFrancesca Grasso, University of Turin (Italy)\rRoberto Nai, University of Turin (Italy)\rEmilio Sulis, University of Turin (Italy)\r PROGRAM COMMITTEE\r Kolawole ADEBAYO (Dublin City University, Ireland / ADAPT Centre, Ireland)\rValerio BASILE (University of Turin, Italy)\rGuido BOELLA (University of Turin, Italy)\rBeatriz ESTEVES (Universidad Polit\xc3\xa9cnica de Madrid, Spain)\rAlfio FERRARA (University of Milan, Italy)\rStefano MONTANELLI (University of Milan, Italy)\rRohan NANDA (University of Maastricht, Netherlands)\rMar\xc3\xada NAVAS LORO (Universidad Polit\xc3\xa9cnica de Madrid, Spain)\rMonica PALMIRANI (University of Bologna, Italy)\rHarshvardhan J.

Please note that while hybrid formats will be supported for\r   workshops, the Middleware \xe2\x80\x9922 steering committee wants the main\r   conference to be held in in-person only. Prospective attendees of the\r   workshop should keep this in mind if they plan to attend both WoSC8 and\r   Middleware \xe2\x80\x9822.\r    Over the last seven years, Serverless Computing (Serverless) has gained\r   an enthusiastic following in industry as a compelling paradigm for the\r   deployment of cloud applications, and is enabled by the recent shift of\r   enterprise application architectures to containers and microservices.\r   Many of the major cloud vendors have released serverless platforms,\r   including Amazon Lambda, Google Cloud Functions, Microsoft Azure\r   Functions, IBM Cloud Functions. Open source projects are gaining\r   popularity in providing serverless computing as a service.\r    Recently, Kubernetes gained popularity in enterprise and in academia.\r   Several open source projects such as OpenFaaS and Knative aim to\r   provide developers with serverless experience on top of Kubernetes by\r   hiding low-level details. Auto-scalable multi-tenant Kubernetes\r   deployments like Google Cloud Run or IBM Code Engine also overcome\r   previous limitations of Serverless Functions like duration, networking,\r   and higher granularity (more vCPUs).\r    Serverless architectures offer different tradeoffs in terms of control,\r   cost, and flexibility compared to distributed applications built on an\r   Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS) substrate. For example, a serverless\r   architecture requires developers to more carefully consider the\r   resources used by their code (time to execute, memory used, etc.) when\r   modularizing their applications. This is in contrast to concerns around\r   latency, scalability, and elasticity, which is where significant\r   development effort has traditionally been spent when building cloud\r   services. In addition, tools and techniques to monitor and debug\r   applications aren't applicable in serverless architectures, and new\r   approaches are needed. As well, test and development pipelines may need\r   to be adapted. Another decision that developers face is the\r   appropriateness of the serverless ecosystem to their application\r   requirements. A rich ecosystem of services built into the platform is\r   typically easier to compose and would offer better performance.\r   However, composing external services may be unavoidable, and in such\r   cases, many of the benefits of serverless disappear, including\r   performance and availability guarantees. This presents an important\r   research challenge, and it is not clear how existing results and best\r   practices, such as workflow composition research, can be applied to\r   composition in a serverless environment.\r    As this year the workshop is virtual and we are looking not only for\r   research papers, experience papers, demonstrations, or position papers\r   but also for live presentations of ongoing work, demonstrations, and\r   anything else that may be interesting to workshop audience.\r    The latest version of this CFP is available at\r   [2]http://serverlesscomputing.org/wosc8/\r Topics\r    This workshop solicits papers from both academia and industry on the\r   state of practice and state of the art in serverless computing.

As a result, these AI-enabled systems for smart buildings, smart cities, smart grids, electric transportation, among others are attaining better accuracy and efficiency numbers every year. However, these data-driven black-box solutions are rarely held accountable for the impact of their actions on the human in the loop which significantly impacts their real-world adoption. To truly conceptualize the idea of smart systems for everyone, it is critical to study AI-enabled smart environments and energy systems to enforce energy equity and ensure not just clean and resilient energy systems, but also make them affordable and accessible for all. The second ACM SIGEnergy workshop on Fair, Accountable, Transparent, and Ethical AI for Smart Environments and Energy Systems intends to bring together researchers from diverse backgrounds and discuss key issues, challenges, breakthroughs, and socio-economic impact in developing fair, accountable, transparent and ethical AI techniques for smart environments and energy systems.\r The aim of this workshop is to create a platform for the SenSys/BuildSys community to discuss developing AI-enabled smart environments and energy systems that are not just accurate but also take responsibility for their actions. We invite submissions including, but not limited to:\r - Studies exploring type of biases in energy-related data and their implications\r- Challenges in collecting representative data for fair training of the AI models\r- Studies on eXplainable AI (XAI) for smart environments and energy systems\r- Interpretable and explainable ML/AI models\r- Physics-informed ML for model interpretation\r- Innovative ML/AI models and their key limitations pertaining to FATE\r- Socio-economic impact analysis for energy equity\r- Fair metrics for the evaluation of ML/AI methods\r- Exploring visual analytics for bias evaluation in data and models\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=138697"">AISTATS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n25th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Statistics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166668"">PLDI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 44th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158633"">ACM--ICAIP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2022 6th International Conference on Advances in Image Processing (ICAIP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161136"">XKDD 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n4th International Workshop on eXplainable Knowledge Discovery in Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166667"">ESEC/FSE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=135873"">ACM-AMLSP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 4th International Conference on Algorithms, Machine Learning and Signal Processing (AMLSP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166563"">ACM ICHMI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 3rd International Conference on Human\xe2\x80\x93Machine Interaction (ICHMI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166671"">SIGMETRICS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 2023 ACM SIGMETRICS (Winter Deadline)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165909"">ACM ICIIT 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 8th International Conference on Intelligent Information Technology (ICIIT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166564"">ICHMI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 3rd International Conference on Human\xe2\x80\x93Machine Interaction (ICHMI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

NLP resides at the core of our everyday tools\xe2\x80\x93 from the Siri assistant in apple products, translation software, chatbots, spam filters, and search engines, to language correction software, and social media monitoring tools. NLP by combining the knowledge of linguistics and the powerful computer science AI, comprehend the rules and structure of language and creates intelligent systems to understand, analyze, and extract meaning from text and speech. NLP analyzes the different aspects like syntax, semantics, pragmatics, and morphology to understand the structure and meaning of the human text. Then, the power computers can transform this linguistic knowledge into Advanced Machine Learning (AML) algorithms that can solve specific problems and perform desired tasks. Machine Learning and NLP play a crucial role in converting an artificial system into an artificially intelligent system. An Artificially Intelligent system can accept better information in a user-friendly manner by utilizing the power of NLP and processes the received information with ML techniques to perform better predictions. Social media platforms are one of the main generators of textual data where people around the world share their daily life experiences and information with the online society. The social, personal, and professional lives of people on these social networking sites generate not only a huge amount of data but also open doors for researchers and academicians with ample research opportunities. This ample amount of data heterogeneous data needs advanced ML, DL, and intelligent tools and techniques to receive, process, and interpret the information in order to resolve several real-life challenges and make the online social life of people harmless and better. Each chapter in this book will contribute to the technology and methodology perspective to incorporate advanced NLP and Deep learning approaches in collecting, analyzing, visualizing, and processing the social data to solve a wide range of real-life issues. Furthermore, this book will present state-of-the-art research and empirical studies on the role of NLP and DL in social media data.\r Topics to be covered by the Book (but not limited to):\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tNatural Language Processing (NLP): Introduction, Methods, Issues, and Challenges. \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tNatural Language Processing for Online Social Media: Sentiment, Semantic Aspect, Toxicity, and Emotion Analysis.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tRole of Machine/Deep Learning in building prediction systems for Online Social Media platforms.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tIntelligent Artificial systems for Online Social Media.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tStance, Fake, and Toxic News detection systems using Deep NLP techniques.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tInfluential, core node and propaganda identification in Online Social Networks.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tTopic Modeling, Named Entity Recognition (NET), and Hate Speech Detection using NLP and Deep Machine Models\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tOpinion Mining and fake review/comment classification using social media data.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tFake profile, Honey nodes, and Sexual Predator Detection in Online Social Networks.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tTrolling, Cyber-stalking, Cyber-bullying, Identity theft in OSNs: Methods, Issues, and Challenges.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tProtecting, Personal, Social, and Professional Information on Social Media.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tMental health (Depression, Suicidal ideation, mood swing) Prediction and Detection using Online Social Media data.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tUser Behavioral Analysis using Behavioral biometric and digital footprints.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tData Collection (Scrappers, Crawlers, and APIs), Preprocessing, Annotation and Evaluation Techniques: Challenges and Issues.\r Submission Procedure:\r Researchers and practitioners are invited to submit on or before July 6, 2022, a chapter proposal of 1,000 to 2,000 words clearly explaining the mission and concerns of the proposed chapter.

Several resources for languages are not available in their human-created format. Some of the types of resources available are monolingual, multilingual, translation memories, and lexicons. Those types of resources are generally created for formal purposes such as parliamentary collections when parallel and more informal situations when monolingual. The quality and abundance of resources including corpora used for formal reasons is generally higher than those used for informal purposes. Additionally, corpora for low-resource languages, languages with less digital resources available, tends to be less abundant and of lower quality.\r CoCo4MT sets out to be the first workshop centered around research that focuses on corpora creation, cleansing, and augmentation techniques specifically for machine translation. We accept work that covers any spoken language (including high-resource languages) but we are specifically interested in those submissions that are on languages with limited existing resources (low-resource languages) where resources are not highly available. \r The goal of this workshop is to begin to close the gap between corpora available for low-resource translation systems and promote high-quality data for online systems that can be used by native speakers of low-resource languages is of particular interest. Therefore, It will be beneficial if the techniques presented in research papers include their impact on the quality of MT output and how they can be used in the real world.\r CoCo4MT aims to encourage research on new and undiscovered techniques. We hope that submissions will provide high-quality corpora that is available publicly for download and can be used to increase machine translation performance thus encouraging new dataset creation for multiple languages that will, in turn, provide a general workshop to consult for corpora needs in the future. The workshop\xe2\x80\x99s success will be measured by the following key performance indicators:\r - Promotes the ongoing increase in quality of machine translation systems when measured by standard measurements,\r- Provides a meeting place for collaboration from several research areas to increase the availability of commonly used corpora and new corpora,\r- Drives innovation to address the need for higher quality and abundance of low-resource language data.\r TOPICS\r We are highly interested in original research papers  on the topics below; however, we welcome all novel ideas that cover research on corpora techniques.\r - Difficulties with using existing corpora (e.g., political considerations or domain limitations) and their effects on final MT systems,\r- Strategies for collecting new MT datasets (e.g., via crowdsourcing),\r- Data augmentation techniques,\r- Data cleansing and denoising techniques, \r- Quality control strategies for MT data,\r- Exploration of datasets for pretraining or auxiliary tasks for training MT systems.\r SUBMISSION INFORMATION\r There is one type of submission in the workshop:  Research, review and position paper. The length of each paper should be at least four (4) and not exceed ten (10) pages, plus unlimited pages for references. Submissions should be formatted according to the official AMTA 2022 style templates (PDF, LaTeX, Word). Accepted papers will be published on-line in the AMTA 2022 proceedings which includes the ACL Anthology and will be presented at the conference either orally or as a poster. \r Submissions must be anonymized and should be done using the official conference management system (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AMTA2022). Scientific papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must be declared as such, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at CoCo4MT. The review will be double-blind. \r We would like to encourage authors to cite papers written in ANY language that are related to the topics, as long as both original bibliographic items and their corresponding English translations are provided.\r Registration will be handled by the main conference.

We are looking for community discussion and participation on the above topics plus the following. First, component packaging via containers and virtual machines, automation scripting, deployment, portability builds, and system support for these and other relevant activities. Second, provenance collection, exploration, and tracking are key for a well-documented scientific output. Third, issues with managing large data sets and workflow intermediate data, particularly those intended to manage publicly accessed data for use and reuse are encouraged. Finally, new techniques and technologies that address portability and reproducibility requirements, such as those required for peer reviewed publication, are also requested.\r Submission Guidelines\rAll papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference. The following paper categories are welcome:\r Full papers describing emerging and future computational workloads are combining traditional HPC applications with tools and techniques from the scale out data analytics and machine learning community. Getting these technologies to co-exist and interoperate to advance scientific discovery is a daunting task with few known good solutions. In general, constructing these workflows has the potential to create pitfalls and incompatibilities that limit adoption.\r Formalizing the steps necessary for an application or data processing pipeline is increasingly popular and necessary. Requirements for reproducibility artifacts for publishing venues are also driving this formalization. The processes and infrastructure to accomplish these requirements are frequently bespoke or custom for a particular research area. All of these formalization activities can be described as workflow systems. Existing off-the-shelf tools address a distributed environment fairly well, but are not complete solutions and do not address the scale up community much, if at all.\r Complicating managing workflows are the tasks of managing data both during workflow execution and then afterwards as well as offering authentication and data security for shared data sets. With some data, such as climate simulation output, being subject to intense scrutiny, it becomes crucial to offer open data that can be verified as authentic by means of encrypted creator identities, and accessible only to people with a need to know. Sharing and analyzing the data knowing it is authentic while protecting the privacy of the creators is essential for reliable open science, while protecting the identity of the scientists performing the work.\r This workshop seeks to explore ideas and experiences on what kinds of infrastructure developments can improve upon the state of the art. Explorations of component packaging via containers and virtual machines, automation scripting, deployment, portability builds, and system support for these and other relevant activities are key infrastructure. Provenance collection, exploration, and tracking are key for a well documented scientific output. Using existing systems to achieve these goals via experiences are important for developing best practices that span application domains. Data privacy techniques such as multi-party encryption and differential privacy are important as well. Issues with managing large data sets and workflow intermediate data, particularly those intended to manage publicly accessed data for use and reuse are encouraged. New techniques and technologies that address reproducibility requirements are also requested. We seek work on all of these, and related, topics as well as position and experience papers looking to drive conversation for practitioners and researchers in these spaces.\r This workshop contributes by sharing experiences and exploring the various technological infrastructure needs to support effective, convenient workflow systems and application composition structures and approaches across a broad spectrum of HPC environments from clusters to supercomputers to cloud systems.\r Paper submission guidelines: \r Papers should be formatted in IEEE format following eScience formatting rules and can be 5 pages not including references.

Nowadays, digital technology applications contribute on a daily basis to recording, preservation, research and dissemination in the digital humanities. Digitization is the defining practice that bridges science and technology with the humanities, either in tangible or in the intangible forms. The digital replicas enable a wide range of studies, opening new horizons in humanities research. Advances in artificial intelligence and its successful application in core technical domains brings new possibilities to support humanities research in particularly demanding and challenging tasks.\r AI applications in humanities research have a significant impact on multi-model and multi-dimensional information sharing and the representation of knowledge, enabling a reflection on historical trends, culture and identity. AI has already been used in a diverse set of applications, ranging from effective asset organization and knowledge representation to virtual and cyber archaeology, advanced and extended visualization, asset and context interpretation, intelligent tools, personalized access, and to gamification and public dissemination.\r This Special Issue focuses on the forthcoming future of artificial intelligence applications in digital humanities, including recent developments ranging from deep and reinforcement learning approaches to recommendation technologies in the extended reality domain.\r AI is currently reshaping humanities research, and the following research areas are just broad indicative cases of this evolution: digitization and preventive preservation with AI; interpretation and restoration with AI; predictive modelling with AI; heritage analytics with AI; dissemination with AI; personalization and inclusive design with AI.\r In this Special Issue, original research articles and reviews are welcome. Research areas may include (but are not limited to) the following:\r - Advanced, multi-scale, multi-modal and automated digitization;\r- Big data approaches in digital humanities;\r- From digital to cyber humanities;\r- Preventive preservation;\r- Climate change and heritage protection;\r- Decoding of ancient epigraph marks;\r- Deciphering of ancient languages, texts, epigraphs;\r- Automatic restoration of lost texts and images;\r- Predictive modeling in humanities research;\r- Digital resources with open linked data and semantic web capacity;\r- Advanced analysis and annotation of artifacts;\r- AI approaches in heritage science and physicochemical analysis;\r- Authentication, traceability and prevention of illicit trafficking;\r- Citizen science, and citizen involvement;\r- Extended (virtual, augmented, etc.) reality applications;\r- Advanced personalization and recommender technologies;\r- Inclusive design.\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164908"">IIoTBDSC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nElectronics MDPI Special Issue- Advances in Industrial IoT, Big Data and Supply Chain for IIoTBDSC\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163498"">IEEE ICCCBDA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 the 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163497"">ICCCBDA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 the 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166804"">ACBT 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 Asia Conference on Blockchain Technologies (ACBT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166548"">ICCSN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 15th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167101"">FEMIB 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Conference on Finance, Economics, Management and IT Business\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152340"">IEEE SSCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158794"">SI PMABD 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpecial Issue on Programming Models and Algorithms for Big Data\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163176"">ICDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n23th Industrial Conference on Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Long-anticipated resource scarcity, pollution, and global warming are all likely to become increasingly tangible, with the potential to drastically change the world as we know it, including cities and what nourishes them from the outside. Supply shortages, extreme weather, new health emergencies, and geopolitical tensions may depict uncertain scenarios that, however, cannot be left waiting, simply labelled as black swan events. Present evidence and scientific forecasts about climate change and its tipping points have recently led even United Nations Secretary-General Ant\xc3\xb3nio Guterres to make desperate pleas for urgent action, since the very future of humanity is at stake.\r Discourses on sustainability and resilience have multiplied in recent times, yet with frequently different meanings of these concepts and often with local or sectorial applications. We may argue that the present and upcoming challenges demand more: sustainability as the ambitious goal to restore human rhythms able to be also feasible in the future, starting from resource use, waste and pollution production, and induced climate change, without compromising the liveableness of the next (and\xe2\x80\x94alas\xe2\x80\x94also our) generations, and without forgetting the social dimensions, starting from equity; resilience as a no less ambitious effort to reduce the vulnerability of human systems, to overcome and to adapt to shocks and drastic changes, whose causes, partly triggered by past and present mistakes, must also be addressed through sustainability-seeking actions.\r This Special Issue aims at addressing the underexplored sustainability and resilience interface by keeping in mind the deepest meanings of these concepts, as well as the uncertainty and the unpleasant hints about the turbulent era we are approaching. Of course, the past and existing valuable experiences with sustainability and resilience may be addressed and reported too, but their critical assessment and discussion, in light of the above, is strongly encouraged here.\r While well aware of the pressing needs that may affect scientific research and professional practice (including, but not limited to, the dependency upon funding and structural disciplinary boundaries), hard times can be seen as an occasion to move further. Aware, critical, and forward-looking contributions about sciences, plans, policies, and actions to effectively reduce the unsustainability and increase the resilience of human systems in a difficult epoch like this are all welcome, with a preference for urban and regional systems and for their interconnections with the many sectors upon which they depend.\r Dr. Silvio Cristiano\rGuest Editor\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166516"">URS  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nUrban Regeneration and Sustainability (URS) - 3rd Edition\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156558"">Springer--ACESD 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpringer--2022 7th Asia Conference on Environment and Sustainable Development (ACESD 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165182"">RPSER 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nRepurposing places for social and environmental resilience International Conference 2023.

From its humble beginnings as a mnemo-technic to its complicated uses in psychology and psychoanalysis, memory has stirred wide and transformative questions, particularly with its deployment in sociology. Halbwachs\xe2\x80\x99 notion of collective memory (1925) has since been a fixture of what became known as Memory Studies. This movement toward the social has led to the profusion of works around \xe2\x80\x9ccollective memory,\xe2\x80\x9d which Olick and Robbins (1998) claim, became the core of scholarly exploration in early 20th century. Varied disciplines, such as literature, sociology, archive science, and historiography, among others, draw on the epistemological frameworks that developed the fields that engage with remembering. The rise in interest in commemorative practices after WWI and WWII has brought attention to genealogies, biographies, diaries, museums, and monuments, giving more presence to questions of trauma, loss, memory and history. Hence Memory studies have directed attention to the ways in which memory has become a cultural and sociological practice whose roots are entangled in political and identitarian issues and institutions (Assmann 1995; Rothberg 1993).\rMemory has become the glue that cements groups and communities, endowing them with commonalties that allow them to build shared ethos and identities. Ironically, Pierre Nora has written that ""we speak so much of memory because there is so little of it left\xe2\x80\x9d (1984) or rather because memories occupy such a pivotal place in shaping national identities that there is not enough of it. Sites of memory, commemorative practices, museums, historiographical projects, autobiographies, rituals, pilgrimages, and annual celebrations of victories are all deeply immersed in memory, which shapes the commemorating societies\xe2\x80\x99 present in light of their past. However, there is a significant difference between memory practices in the Global North and their counterparts in the Global South. The North suffers from a glut of memory whereas the Global South has yet to fully account for seminal historical events that have far-reaching resonances for its nations and societies. While there is a focus on memories of resistance to colonialism, one can easily observe the selective nature of commemorations. Specifically, memory in North Africa, which is a vast region with an incredible cultural diversity, has been mostly driven by statal actors who focus on official aspects of the past. Groups and communities that did not fit the national narratives were simply left out (Boum 2013).\rImazighen, Arabs, sub-Saharans, and Jews are some of the groups that have yet to occupy their rightful place in North African memory. Although these groups are heavily present in the quotidian life of their societies, both physically and symbolically, their inclusion in the commemorative projects will be salutary for the future of these societies. The public sphere has not been amply flexile for the diverse cultural identities of the region, affecting the way renditions of the past are reenacted in the present. Official memories have overshadowed other memories, leading to the appearance of marginal sites of commemoration (El Guabli 2019). The overpowering presence of an official, unifying approach to memory counters the very essential trait of memories as being diverse, in-flux, and malleable.\rThis conference aims to reflect on a rich array of memory-focused topics, including performance rituals, celebrations, festivals, objects, places, literature, artifacts, and specific historical moments using the interdisciplinary methodologies honed in Memory Studies. We seek papers that draw on Memory Studies to reflect on issues related to identity, history, historiography, commemoration, remembrance, and changing conceptions of the self and the collective in North Africa. Thus, we ask how much memory is present in the North African spheres? How have\rmemories of the past in North Africa been promoted and appropriated for the sake of a more flexible public sphere? Who are the memory stakeholders? How do they mobilize memory? What place do minority memories occupy in the grand narratives of different states? Can \xe2\x80\x98subaltern\xe2\x80\x99 memories exist and be performed in public?\rWe invite scholars in all disciplines to submit their proposals. The themes of papers may include, but are not restricted to, the topics of:\r- (Post)Colonial Memories in North Africa\r- Memory dynamics and the Public Sphere in the Maghreb\r- Representations of cultural memory in literature in North Africa\r- Competitive/comparative models of cultural memory in North African states\r- Memories and Trauma transformation\r- Cultural memory in institutional discourse\r- Amazigh memories/identities in North Africa\r- Narratives of Jewish memories/identities in North Africa\r- Migrants\xe2\x80\x99 Memories across borders\r- Cultural memory in Film and Music\r- \xe2\x80\x98Vernacular\xe2\x80\x99 and \xe2\x80\x98Subaltern\xe2\x80\x99 Memories\r- Cultural Memory in individual Diaries, Memoirs, and (Auto)biographies\r- Memories and Identities in History Textbooks\r- Museums, Monuments, and Photographs\r- Digital Memories and Modes of Transmission\r- Transitional/Restorative Justice and Memory\rBy hosting an interdisciplinary conference, we hope to cross-fertilize local engagements with memory by a wider engagement with the approaches and methodologies that have been generative in other academic settings and social contexts.\r Confirmed Keynote speakers:\r Dr. Aomar Boum                                Dr. Brahim El Guabli\rUniversity of California Los-Angeles, CA      Williams College, Massachusetts\rPlease submit a 400-word abstract as well as a short bio to the organizing committee (minaconference2022@gmail.com) by July 5, 2022.

Browsing through hours of video data to retrieve useful information is a tedious and boring task. Video Summarization technology has played a crucial role in addressing this issue. It is a well-researched topic in the multimedia community. However, the focus so far has been limited to creating summary to videos which are short (only a few minutes).\r This workshop aims to call for researchers on relevant background to focus on novel solutions for user-centric narrative summarization of long videos. Specifically, the goal is to provide the users with meaningful information and insights from long input videos, potentially captured from multiple cameras. Since the generated output of any video summarization task will be finally consumed by humans, it is also important to have an element of storytelling, where the resulting summary is presented in the form of a narrative for humans to understand easily. This workshop will also cover other important aspects of video summarization research like what is ""important"" in a video, how to evaluate the goodness of a created summary, etc.\r --------------------------------------------------\rTOPICS OF INTEREST (including but not limited to)\r--------------------------------------------------\r* Summarization of single/multiple long videos\r* Action and scene graph generation from videos\r* Narrative summary and video storytelling\r* Datasets for long video summarization\r* Novel evaluation criteria/metrics\r* Novel application of long video summarization\r* Open challenges in video summarization\r* Privacy preserved video summarization\r ------------------------------\rIMPORTANT DATES\r------------------------------\r* Paper submission deadline: July 15, 2022\r* Acceptance notification: July 31, 2022\r* Camera-ready submission: August 7, 2022\r ------------------------------\rPAPER SUBMISSION\r------------------------------\rAll submissions (including Work-In-Progress) must be original works not under review at any other workshop, conference, or journal.

The smart wireless sensor network is one of the great research topis among the modest technologies seeking greater attention worldwide due to its broad range of commercial significance. Advanced sensors and sensing technologies significantly impact everyday aspects of people\'s lives since they can positively transform the process and manage agricultural practices, resulting in the development of precision agriculture.Agriculture has been facing a crucial challenge in recent days to please the needs of the rising population without draining the available resources. Hence, energy-aware wireless sensor networks come into action in innovative agricultural industries. Precision agriculture is the science that employs data from various sources to facilitate agricultural production and increase environmentally friendly crop management techniques. The advancing sensor network like WSNs (Wireless Sensor Networks) and IoT (Internet of Things) implied networks play a vital role in monitoring agricultural yield, fertilizer requirements, groundwater monitoring, plant mapping, pest management, etc. sensor node of WSNs aids in monitoring the environmental conditions like humidity, rainfall, the temperature which is the significant criteria for the cultivation process in the precision agriculture-intending at better energy consumption for emerging protocols that contribute to mitigating the energy consumption of sensing technology considerably. The incorporation of WSNs is expected to bring out substantial changes in precision agriculture, which aids in the development of disease management processes and pest control system in an agricultural field. IoT-assisted drone system permits efficient monitoring in intelligent farming, animal husbandry management, and livestock. Research envisaged that amalgamation of WSNs with other technological features is found to have numerous applications when implied for agriculture like big data analytics, cloud computing, IoT. In specific UAV (Unmanned Aerial Vehicle) and 6G wireless communication technology aids to provide more excellent benefits in the groundwater monitoring, this shows higher growth in precision agriculture. This special issue is intended to cover contributions in all aspects of cloud-centric and outsourced computing such as a Service, Categories, Network, Infrastructure, Platform, Function and software.\r The special issue provides myriad opportunities for scholars and academicians to discuss the securing implementing WSNs in precision agriculture. Despite having many beneficial trends, it also holds certain limitations to be observed.

For decades, oral history was considered less than scholarly, leading to its exclusion from several history books; thus valuable first-hand experiences and information that could alter historical truth were neglected and ultimately lost to oblivion. We wish to challenge the pervading view that oral testimony can lead to false representation of historical events; and underline the significant support they can provide to historical research, especially in lieu of written documentation. \r We also hope to focus on the connections between oral history, collective memory, and individual memory. Whether from a historical, social, or even psychological approach we wish to engage scholars in a multidimensional and interdisciplinary approach in order to deeply explore all aspects of this valuable and fascinating discipline. \r We invite scholars from different fields including history, philosophy, religion, sociology, international relations, literature, art, space studies, peace studies, cultural studies, minority studies, war and/or genocide studies, journalism, immigration studies, psychology and psychiatry, political and social studies, and those working in archives, museums and NGOs. \r Proposed Topics \r -Oral history throughout history\r-Oral historian: a public historian? Oral history as a form of social and communal activity;\r-Conducting oral history research: Methodologies and techniques\r-Re-examining and re-writing history through the lens of oral history\r-Epistemological and ethical dilemmas in oral history\r-Collective/Individual memory and oral tradition\r-Manipulation of memory and the role of oral history\r-Oral history and trauma\r-Oral history as a tool of revealing/reliving a dictatorship/suppressing regime\r-Altering, exaggerating or forgetting memories; the psychology of a survivor\r-Oral history in teaching and teaching oral history\r Proposed Formats (Lingua franca: English)\r-Individual papers (GIRES will included it in a panel)\r-Panels (up to 4 presentations-chaired by one of the presenters or appointed by GIRES)\r-Roundtable presentations (chaired by one of the presenters or appointed by GIRES)\r-Poster presentations\r-Student presentations (one paper presented by up to 3 young scholars)\r-Keynote speech (depending on the time availability)\r-Pre-recorder presentation (s) (Asynchronous Platform)\r-Pre-recorder presentation (s) (Synchronous-live- Sessions: live participation of presenter (s) during the Q&A sessions)\r Publication Opportunity \rThe Organizing Committee and GIRES Press will publish the most powerful and dynamic presentations of the conference and include them\rin a collective volume in the form of short articles and/or long essays.

However, we need to further investigate the impacts of these options to reduce unwanted side effects and improve the quality of life for patients.\xe2\x80\x9d Special Issue Editor Dr. Jian Zhang, Attending Surgeon, Senior researcher, Sun Yat-Sen University of Medical Sciences\r Gastrointestinal cancer is a leading cause of cancer death worldwide, especially in some regions of Asia. Major advances in cancer therapeutics have led to a remarkable reduction in gastrointestinal cancer mortality. However, these improvements come with the limitation of a range of side effects, that affect most patients with varying severity, and that clinicians and researchers need to treat and investigate. With the emergence of new therapeutics, such as immunotherapy, improving our understanding of therapy-related side effects is a vital and meaningful goal.\r \xe2\x80\x9cNew results are emerging in the field of non-surgical treatment of gastrointestinal tumors, but the application of these results is limited due to the existence of side effects of treatment.

(collocated with CC-2023, HPCA-2023 and CGO-2023) Dates: 25 February - 1 March, 2023.\r Submission URL: https://ppopp23.hotcrp.com\r # Important dates:\r     Full paper submission: August 17, 2022\r    Author response period: October 26\xe2\x80\x93October 28, 2022\r    Author notification: November 7, 2022\r    Artifact submission to AE committee: November 16, 2022\r    Artifact notification by AE committee: December 30, 2022\r    Final paper due: January 6, 2023\r All deadlines are at midnight anywhere on earth (AoE), and are firm.\r # Scope:\r PPoPP is the premier forum for leading work on all aspects of parallel programming, including theoretical foundations, techniques, languages, compilers, runtime systems, tools, and practical experience. In the context of the symposium, \xe2\x80\x9cparallel programming\xe2\x80\x9d encompasses work on concurrent and parallel systems (multicore, multi-threaded, heterogeneous, clustered, and distributed systems; grids; data centers; clouds; and large scale machines). Given the rise of parallel architectures in the consumer market (desktops, laptops, and mobile devices) and data centers, PPoPP is particularly interested in work that addresses new parallel workloads and issues that arise out of extreme-scale applications or cloud platforms, as well as techniques and tools that improve the productivity of parallel programming or work towards improved synergy with such emerging architectures.\r Specific topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r     Compilers and runtime systems for parallel and heterogeneous systems\r    Concurrent data structures\r    Development, analysis, or management tools\r    Fault tolerance for parallel systems\r    Formal analysis and verification\r    High-performance / scientific computing\r    Libraries\r    Middleware for parallel systems\r    Parallel algorithms\r    Parallel applications and frameworks\r    Parallel programming for deep memory hierarchies including nonvolatile memory\r    Parallel programming languages\r    Parallel programming theory and models\r    Parallelism in non-scientific workloads: web, search, analytics, cloud, machine learning\r    Performance analysis, debugging and optimization\r    Programming tools for parallel and heterogeneous systems\r    Software engineering for parallel programs\r    Software for heterogeneous architectures\r    Software productivity for parallel programming\r    Synchronization and concurrency control\r Papers should report on original research relevant to parallel programming and should contain enough background materials to make them accessible to the entire parallel programming research community. Papers describing experience should indicate how they illustrate general principles or lead to new insights; papers about parallel programming foundations should indicate how they relate to practice. PPoPP submissions will be evaluated based on their technical merit and accessibility. Submissions should clearly motivate the importance of the problem being addressed, compare to the existing body of work on the topic, and explicitly and precisely state the paper\xe2\x80\x99s key contributions and results towards addressing the problem. Submissions should strive to be accessible both to a broad audience and to experts in the area.\r # Paper Submission:\r Conference submission site: https://ppopp23.hotcrp.com.\r All submissions must be made electronically through the conference web site and include an abstract (100\xe2\x80\x93400 words), author contact information, the full list of authors and their affiliations. Full paper submissions must be in PDF formatted printable on both A4 and US letter size paper.\r All papers must be prepared in ACM Conference Format using the 2-column acmart format: use the SIGPLAN proceedings template acmart-sigplanproc-template.tex for Latex,and interim-layout.docx for Word. You may also want to consult the official ACM information on the Master Article Template and related tools. Important note: The Word template (interim-layout.docx) on the ACM website uses 9pt font; you need to increase it to 10pt.\r Papers should contain a maximum of 10 pages of text (in a typeface no smaller than 10 point) or figures, NOT INCLUDING references. There is no page limit for references and they must include the name of all authors (not {et al.}). Appendices are not allowed, but the authors may submit supplementary material, such as proofs or source code; all supplementary material must be in PDF or ZIP format. Looking at supplementary material is at the discretion of the reviewers.\r Submission is double blind and authors will need to identify any potential conflicts of interest with PC and Extended Review Committee members, as defined here: http://www.sigplan.org/Resources/Policies/Review/ (ACM SIGPLAN policy).\r PPoPP 2023 will employ a double-blind reviewing process. To facilitate this process, submissions should not reveal the identity of the authors in any way. Authors should leave out author names and affiliations from the body of their submission. They should also ensure that any references to authors\xe2\x80\x99 own related work should be in the third person (e.g., not \xe2\x80\x9cWe build on our previous work \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d but rather \xe2\x80\x9cWe build on the work of \xe2\x80\xa6\xe2\x80\x9d). The purpose of this process is to help the PC and external reviewers come to an initial judgment about the paper without bias, not to make it impossible for them to discover the authors if they were to try. Nothing should be done in the name of anonymity that weakens the submission or makes the job of reviewing the paper more difficult. In particular, important background references should not be omitted or anonymized. In addition, authors should feel free to disseminate their ideas or draft versions of their paper as they normally would. For instance, authors may post drafts of their papers on the web or give talks on their research ideas. Authors with further questions on double-blind reviewing are encouraged to contact the Program Chairs by email.\r Submissions should be in PDF and printable on both US Letter and A4 paper. Papers may be resubmitted to the submission site multiple times up until the deadline, but the last version submitted before the deadline will be the version reviewed. Papers that exceed the length requirement, that deviate from the expected format, or that are submitted late will be rejected.\r All submissions that are not accepted for regular presentations will be automatically considered for posters. Two-page summaries of accepted posters will be included in the conference proceedings.\r To allow reproducibility, we encourage authors of accepted papers to submit their papers for Artifact Evaluation (AE). The AE process begins after the acceptance notification, and is run by a separate committee whose task is to assess how the artifacts support the work described in the papers. Artifact evaluation is voluntary and will not affect paper acceptance, but will be taken into consideration when selecting papers for awards. Papers that go through the AE process successfully will receive one or several of the ACM reproducibility badges, printed on the papers themselves. More information will be posted on the AE website.\r Deadlines expire at midnight anywhere on earth.\r  # Workshop/Tutorial Proposals:\r We are soliciting proposals for workshops and tutorials within the general scope of PPoPP. Members of the community are encouraged to submit proposals for workshops/tutorials that bring together researchers and practitioners to share their tools, technologies, latest results and to discuss work in progress and new directions. Please submit proposals to the PPoPP 2023 Workshops and Tutorials Chair, Zoran Budimli\xc4\x87 (zoran@tamu.edu). Workshop and tutorial proposals will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. Early submissions are encouraged and will be evaluated immediately. Please note that for workshops that wish to publish accepted submissions in the ACM Digital Library special rules apply. Such workshops also require approval by the SIGPLAN executive committee.

Emerging application areas such as smart transportation logistics, smart cities, healthcare, and industry 4.0 sectors encompassing highly distributed services that use many devices involving large-scale data generation, gathering, storage, and analysis in real-time further encourage its adoption. While the geo-distributed and federated nature of the continuum continues to improve the agility, responsiveness, and effectiveness of such distributed applications. This paradigmatic shift in the post-digital transformation era has also triggered drastically changing expectations of dynamic service deployment and infrastructure usage patterns, further introducing significant complexities to the Edge-Cloud management layers. These include challenges related to performance sustainability, sprawl management, resilience, and scalability of massive digital operations and services. These issues break down to reconciling many and typically allude to dynamically changing demand, requirements, and constraints of digital applications, which require the Edge-Cloud infrastructures to be deployed in sites that are in large numbers and are sometimes located in remote areas. To manage such fault-prone Edge-Cloud systems, infrastructure and service providers rely on human-intensive means to meet the increasing capacity demand and high availability of digital services. However, due to the continuously changing landscape, utilizing manual interventions to manage such large-scale systems is implausible. Hence, mitigating such issues requires digital applications and Edge-Cloud infrastructure to reposition their focus from adopting more efficient, effective, quick, and cheap compute capabilities to embracing more autonomous and self-driven technologies.  \r Recently, Intelligent Cloud Operations and Services (a.k.a AIOps) gained traction that advocates using AI/ML techniques to embed intelligence at the Edge-Cloud management layers and automate digital operations and services by only requiring human intervention for critical issues beyond automation capabilities. While AIOps is still in an emerging phase, academia and industry foresee many possible advancements ranging from root-cause analysis, early anomaly detection, and mitigation to predictive and prescriptive maintenance and management in Edge-Cloud systems. Additionally, such AIOps powered transformation can ensure that the continuum supply chain meets the heightened user demands in terms of openness, security, privacy and resilience, energy and resource efficiency and provide Cloud-Edge technologies with an ability to scale, accelerate innovation and enable industry-specific needs.\r The Intel4EC workshop aims to bring together researchers, developers and practitioners from academia and industry to present their experiences, results and research progress covering architectural designs, methods and applications of AI/ML-enabled Edge-Cloud operations and services. By bringing together these research topics, Intel4EC looks forward to help the community define open standards, AI/ML benchmarks that contribute to experiment reproducibility and systematize the complete management pipeline for a myriad of Cloud-Edge operations.\r Intel4EC 2022 workshop aims to attract the Cloud, Fog, Edge, Big Data, AI/ML and distributed computing community for novel research contributions to intelligent, adaptive, manageable and observable Edge-Cloud systems that include topics of interest, but are not limited to:\r Performance instrumentation, monitoring and observability\rCausal attribution and root-cause analysis\rPerformance diagnosis and prognosis\rFailure prediction and fault localisation\rAnomaly detection and prediction\rChaos engineering and analytics\rCapacity planning, scalability and workload management\rEdge-Cloud sprawl management and multi-tenancy issues\rAI/ML techniques for cost and energy-efficient operations\rAdaptive resource provisioning, scheduling and run-time optimisation\rTrust, security and privacy-preserving AI/ML\rSLA breach, violation and vulnerability detection\rService discovery and microservice composition\rIntelligent programming models\rDistributed data (e.g. logs, traces) integration, management and analysis\rSelf-adaptive and self-healing systems\rExperiment reproducibility, benchmarks, and application case-studies\r Submission Guidelines:\r The Intel4EC workshop invites original research papers that have not been previously published and are not currently under review for publication elsewhere. Following paper categories are welcome:\r Regular Full Papers: Full research papers should describe the original work and be no longer than 6 pages (+ 2 for additional fee).\r Short Papers: Short research papers up to 4 pages in length, should contain enough information for the program committee to understand the scope of the project and evaluate the novelty of the problem or approach.\r All manuscripts should adhere to page limits and be submitted in PDF using IEEE format. Each paper submitted to the workshop will be peer-reviewed by a minimum of three technical program committee members and will be evaluated on the basis of scientific significance, originality, technical quality, correctness, presentation, and relevance to the workshop attendees.

Challenging the nuclear amnesia that has characterized the post-Cold War years, such nuclear imaginaries foretell the fears and desires of a world laid to waste in an effort to popularize the end time politics of the present. Meanwhile scholars such as Karen Barad, Gabriele Schwab, Elaine Scarry, and Kate Brown have long warned about the systematic silencing of (anti) nuclear debates, theorizing the unfinished business of nuclear disaster and positing a meaningful politics of re-membering nuclear trauma. In this sense, the pressing forward of nuclear apprehensions in recent years is symptomatic of what Avery Gordon identifies as \xe2\x80\x9cghostly matters\xe2\x80\x9d or a particular idea of haunting that allows us to \xe2\x80\x9cthink through repressed forms of violence that bring \xe2\x80\x98something to be done\xe2\x80\x99 in the present.\xe2\x80\x9d In this special issue we want to summon these formations of nuclear ghosts and explore the return of the (repressed) nuclear ethos in popular culture, literature, art, politics, poetry, and philosophy.\r Nuclear ghosts conjure up a critical moment or point of creative anxiety that exposes the cracks in repressive infrastructures of denial. They draw attention to the onto-epistemological ruptures and limits of the nuclear project while illuminating the political and sociocultural pressure points of nuclear threat. Nuclear ghosts thus hover at the intersection between the biopolitical and the psychological, between the ecological and the technological, the political and the intuitive, the present and the absent, then and now, critically evoking the deeply racialized and gendered genealogies of annihilating catastrophes. The ghosts we seek in this issue articulate the entanglements between atomic violence and the ongoing assaults of colonialism, sexism, capitalism, war, environmental destruction, etc., cathecting the apocalyptic ontologies of past, present, and future. They trouble dominant notions of temporality, space, and even materiality, tormenting the bruised nuclear unconscious that Derrida once evoked. Nuclear ghosts pay witness to human/posthuman atrocities and acknowledge a specific nuclear work of death as something that is simultaneously blasting and slow, too fast and too close, abstract and real. Nuclear ghosts, in other words, invoke the spectral domain of apocalyptic imaginaries in their various political scales and urgencies.\rHiroshima and Nagasaki, Chernobyl, and Fukushima all mark defining moments in nuclear history that have occupied collective narratives in countless ways (without necessarily generating lessons). These instances of spectacular (and spectral) extinction have produced eerie points of reference for extraordinary scenes of destruction. At the same time, the slow violence of nuclear testing contradicts notions of exceptional disaster, precisely because it forces itself upon a lived reality defying linear notions of time and injury. Nuclear violence seeps into the earth, the air, the body. Confounding notions of agency and resolution it mediates post/human sensibilities of haunting apt at unfolding the cataclysmic endurance of colonialization. The primary targets of these ongoing atrocities have been marginalized states and indigenous peoples in the Marshall Islands, French Polynesia, Australia, Newe Sogobia, the Christmas Islands, Hawaii, New Mexico and many more. Decolonization, in Eve Tuck\xe2\x80\x99s sense, then, attends to ghosts, confronting the violent denial done to them. \r We are particular interested in contributions that face up to these nuclear hauntings, engaging the entanglements between political violence and nuclear annihilation as tethered to specific modes of (Western) domination. What are the cultural politics of nuclear haunting? How do ghosts invoke the gendered and raced violence of nuclear trauma? When and why do nuclear repressions seize to work? How do nuclear politics reconceptualize notions of temporality and materiality? How do they name the conditions of ontological insecurity and epistemological limits?

The 2nd International Conference of the Department of English, Shahjalal University of Science and Technology, Sylhet 3114, Bangladesh, to be held on January 27-28, 2023, conceptualizes the narratives related to the terms\xe2\x80\x94Refugee, Resistance, and Recognition\xe2\x80\x94 and their articulations in global literary spaces both as distinct and interrelated concepts in the premises of art, literature, language, (social) media, law, and politics in [Post]postcolonial perspectives.\r The Refugee and its attendant complexities\xe2\x80\x94difficulties in ensuring political and social justice, expediting repatriation procedure, and teeming with claimants of refuge\xe2\x80\x94is a critical predicament worldwide. This conference casts a critical look into the refugees \xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x94a much-debated issue subject to multidisciplinary and scholarly approaches\xc2\xad\xe2\x80\x94in terms of the subjects\xe2\x80\x99 \xe2\x80\x98positionality\xe2\x80\x99 at the intersections of class, caste, religion, race, and gender. Instead of approaching the refugee crisis through a one-sided lens, the conference plans to address refugees all over the world as a \xe2\x80\x98man-made crisis,\xe2\x80\x99 which might endorse and create space to ask questions such as i) Can we study the issue as a site whereby refugees assert their voices claiming their rights in different ways? ii) How do their movements shape the contours of the geopolitical economy and unsettle/influence the insider/outsider dichotomy? iii) What representations do they get \xe2\x80\x94their lot, agency, and voice \xe2\x80\x94in the host and other literary spaces?\r Besides these, we will further look into the narratives of Resistance and its articulation in literary representations, connecting it to the refugee crisis and also as a distinct concept. Here, we look for the narratives of dissent and unruly to conceptualize the interrelation between the refugee and the process of resistance. We will ponder how resistance has been conceptualized in the fields of rebellion and nationalist political movements against encroaching power structures? How are spatial and teleological narratives of resistance taking place in micro/macro spaces or Global North/South to bring forth/make the invisible power structures visible?\r And the subsequent stage brings forth the process of recognition. Here, we delve into the tales of resistance in personal, social, and national as well as international spheres leading to the state of recognition, be it in terms of involuntary giving in or voluntary yielding. The arena of recognition might encompass a temporary win over a disciplining authority as well as a permanent reshuffling of the encroaching policies or mechanisms of world politics. However, we do not intend to romanticize the notion of recognition; instead, we question the criterion of being eligible to be recognized and of being ineligible. Thus, we look for the nuances and politics behind the recognition process. In addition, we consider the process of recognition in different geographic locations and everyday circumstances where newer forms of center/periphery dichotomy reclaim their spaces.\r Critically and theoretically, we adopt [Post]post-colonial, albeit an askance, lens in conceptualizing the forgoing trio. Instead of maintaining an unequivocal stance on the term post-colonial, placing it on the teleological past, we aim to cast a dubious look at the parenthetical term \xe2\x80\x98post.\xe2\x80\x99 Here, the term \xe2\x80\x98post\xe2\x80\x99 does not signify colonialism as a matter of past, as something \xe2\x80\x98over.\xe2\x80\x99 Rather we see it as an unremitting phenomenon pervading all aspects of our life, albeit in newer forms like Neocolonialism or Artificial Intelligence (AI). However, our present conjecture on the term may not be beyond the realm of skepticism. This conference invites scholarly engagement with [Post] post-colonial framework whereby its pastness and presentness will be discussed and debated. Thus, it entertains an all-encompassing perspective of the viewers, reviewers, learners, critics, and readers.\r     Prospective research sub-topics for the conference include, but are not limited to:\r 1.

FPGAs can tailor the hardware to the application, avoiding overheads and achieving higher hardware efficiency than general-purpose architectures. Leading FPGA manufacturers have recently made a concerted effort to provide a range of higher-level, easier-to-use high-level programming models for FPGAs, and much of the work in FPGA-based deep learning is built on these frameworks.\r Such initiatives are already stimulating new interest within the HPC community around the potential advantages of FPGAs over other architectures. With this in mind, this workshop, now in its eighth year, brings together HPC and heterogeneous-computing researchers to demonstrate and share experiences on how newly-available high-level programming models, including OpenCL, are already empowering HPC software developers to directly leverage FPGAs, and to identify future opportunities and needs for research in this area.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=62259"">OpenSuCo @ ISC HPC 2017</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2017 International Workshop on Open Source Supercomputing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163567"">ICMAI--SCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 8th International Conference on Mathematics and Artificial Intelligence (ICMAI 2023)--SCI\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165682"">MNHACK 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCFP: 4th MARENOSTRUM HACKATHON\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164334"">ExaMPI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nExaMPI22 - Workshop on Exascale MPI 2022 @ SC22\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166278"">FPGA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nINTERNATIONAL SYMPOSIUM ON FIELD-PROGRAMMABLE GATE ARRAYS\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160970"">HPCA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nHigh-Performance Computer Architecture\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155720"">SBAC-PAD 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 34th IEEE International Symposium on Computer Architecture and High Performance Computing            \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=138562"">HEART 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157330"">HiPC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n29th IEEE International Conference on High Performance Computing, Data &amp; Analytics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=138563"">HEART 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Symposium on Highly Efficient Accelerators and Reconfigurable Technologies\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Serials like Teen Wolf, The Chilling Adventures of Sabrina, and the Vampire Diaries center their narratives on supernatural subjects while occasionally addressing topics that are relevant to teen audiences. Despite the gains made in media regarding inclusion, there are instances when topics, such as race, gender, and sexuality, are avoided in teen serials, which, it may be argued, should be safe spaces where addressing these subjects is most needed. This collection seeks to examine instances in teen supernatural serials that effectively address socially relevant topics, exploring how these subjects are broached while adhering to the overarching theme, and to explore instances in which these serials avoid social issues, opting instead to perform an erasure of any theme that might stray from an \xe2\x80\x98American family values\xe2\x80\x99 perspective. Some possible topics include, but are not limited to, the following:\r \xe2\x80\xa2\tDepictions of race, or lack thereof\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tDisrupting the heteronormative \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tFeminist activism or rejecting feminism \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tRejecting religion or embracing religious ideology \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tFamily structures and disruptions\r  Some possible teen supernatural serials include, but are not limited to:\r \xe2\x80\xa2\tVampire Diaries\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe Chilling Adventures of Sabrina\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBuffy the Vampire Slayer\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tHemlock Grove\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tStranger Things\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBlack Lightning\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tLegacies\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tRaising Dion\r For consideration, please submit a 50-word author biography and a 300-word abstract, including a reference list of 5 peer-reviewed sources minimum, with current affiliation and contact email address to calexander@tuskegee.edu.\r Final essays should be between 5000 and 7000 words, follow the Chicago Manual of Style, 16th ed., use 12 pt.

ROOTS solicits contributions that focus on theorems and root shells: In security, two things you absolutely cannot argue with.\rSecurity is hard to define. Most often, security is defined by its absence. For scientists, this is particularly unsatisfactory. A lack of definition increases the difficulty to find suitable quantitive and qualitative models. Even though the overall landscape is blurry at best; exploitation, reverse engineering, and offensive techniques have their place.

Its function is to monitor network traffic at all protocol layers, from the physical layer to the applications, and to capture traffic patterns, relationships, and anomalies in the time dimension and volume dimension to support fundamental network functions and upper-layer services, such as load balancing, routing, intrusion detection, traffic engineering, and performance diagnosis. Recently, the explosive Internet traffic growth, the emerging networking paradigms, and the surging network service demands have opened new challenges for traffic measurement, which have gained significant attention from both academia and industry. However, the state-of-the-art solutions, which mainly focus on single-point measurement scenarios and derive probabilistic formulas to measure elementary metrics like frequency, cardinality, and persistence, cannot meet the arising heterogeneous and fine-grained measurement requirements on performance, throughput, scalability, response time, and diversity. For example, modern switches can forward packets at extremely high throughput (up to several Gpps), practically two orders of magnitude higher than the throughput of existing sketch solutions. For another example, application-oriented sketches that provide timely and accurate features beyond elementary metrics to applications like traffic engineering and intrusion detection systems can undoubtedly benefit such systems, while the design of such sketches and the derivation of measurement formulas are non-trivial problems. Thus, there is an urgent need for systematic and in-depth research on network-wide and AI-powered traffic measurement methods to meet new network traffic characteristics and support emerging applications.\r It is expected that the next-generation network management systems will feature network-wide measurement algorithms. The big network data is distributed in nature as the sources and destinations of connections may span the entire network. It is thus essential to aggregate the views of multiple measurement points to build a network-wide perception and capture comprehensive and accurate traffic information. Besides, with a proper task breakdown schema, multiple measurement points can federatively run measurements in a completely parallel and distributed manner, reducing the computation overhead and hardware requirement. Another latest trend involves artificial intelligence technologies that allow seamless aggregation of multi-resolution and heterogeneous network traffic data while advancing traffic measurement systems' design, deployment, and application. Additionally, the interplay between traffic measurement and artificial intelligence is bidirectional. Besides using AI intelligence to power traffic measurement, traffic measurement methods can also aid the AI systems since AI systems are often deployed in a decentralized environment where communication plays an important role. For instance, sketches, a family of traditional measurement methods, can naturally compress the input data and approximate its distribution. It can be used as the medium to transfer gradients among distributed AI systems, striking a tradeoff among information compression, convergence time, and system accuracy.\r This special issue is intended to encourage scholars and experts to systematically discuss the latest research progress and development trends for next-generation traffic measurement, promote in-depth research, and share academic and technical achievements.\r The topics of this SI include, but are not limited to:\r - Network-wide traffic measurement algorithms and systems\r- Use of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and data analytics in network traffic measurement and its applications\r- Network-wide and/or AI-powered traffic measurement for the Internet, edge networks, data center networks, cloud-based systems, software-defined networks, online social networks, online services, and next-generation networks\r- Traffic measurement with programmable hardware and software platforms\r- Traffic measurement with privacy preservation and anonymization\r- AI-powered design, simulation, modeling, analysis, and visualization for next-generation traffic measurement\r- Validation and repeatability of network-wide and/or AI-powered traffic measurements, shared datasets, or collaborative platforms\r- Novel applications of network-wide and AI-powered traffic measurement for load balancing, flow scheduling, network management, and network evolution\r- Novel applications of network-wide and AI-powered traffic measurement for security, anomaly/vulnerability/attack detection, and user profiling/privacy\r- Novel applications of traffic measurement for artificial intelligence and machine learning\r Submission Guidelines\r Papers submitted to this special issue for possible publication must be original and must not be under consideration for publication in any other journal or conference.\rAll papers are to be submitted through the journal editorial submission system.

Privatization of digital commons also introduces the potential for monopolistic abuse, such as: stifled innovation, price discriminations, and distorted market knowledge discovery. We aim to explore within this workshop viable alternatives to 'winner-takes-all' platform ecosystems. Failure of market mechanisms to address these issues suggest that such infrastructures could be treated as commons. We recognize the promising avenue of research build on Nobel laureate Ostroms idea that commons is the third way to organize complex human cooperation, beyond capitalist regulation or governmental regulations.\r Scientific challenges include, but are not limited to: the Tragedy of the Commons in such shared-resource systems, fake identities with Sybil attacks, robot economy, trustworthiness in general, self-organizing machine learning, market infrastructures in cashless society, and governance issues in decentralized systems.\r This workshop focuses on the tools, frameworks, and algorithms to support the common good in a distributed environment. Both theoretical work and experimental approaches are welcomed. Reproducibility, open source and public datasets are endorsed. Each submission must clearly contribute to the middleware community, to facilitate the development of applications by providing higher-level abstractions for better programmability, performance, scalability, and security.\r Scope:\r The topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r-Distributed algorithms\r-Trust and reputation systems\r-Fault-tolerance\r-Gossip-based learning and behavioral models\r-Self-sovereign identity\r-Peer-to-peer networks\r-Game-theoretic approaches to tragedy of commons\r-Markets, mechanism design, and incentives\r-Computational social choice\r-Incentives for participants\r-Fairness in market systems\r-Decentralized governance\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155751"">InWeS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n13th International Conference on Internet Engineering &amp; Web Services\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162980"">3rd Food Chemistry Conference 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd Food Chemistry Conference: Shaping a healthy and sustainable food chain through knowledge\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156516"">ME 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n7th International Conference on Mechanical Engineering\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164020"">OPODIS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n26th Conference on Principles of Distributed Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159698"">BDAB  2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n4th International Conference on Big Data and Blockchain \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165754"">Distributed ML and Opt. 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDistributed Machine Learning and Optimization: Theory and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158752"">CACIT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2nd International Conference on Advances in Computing &amp; Information Technologies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160915"">PDCAT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 23rd International Conference on Parallel and Distributed Computing, Applications and Technologies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167352"">PODC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPrinciples of Distributed Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158635"">ICBTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2022 5th International Conference on Blockchain Technology and Applications (ICBTA 2022)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"
