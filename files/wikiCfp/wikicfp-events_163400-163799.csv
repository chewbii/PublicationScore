Blockchain is recently taking the shape of becoming a tool for security, validation and credibility purposes rather than just being used for mining cryptocurrency. Few of the primary use cases of blockchain outside of crypto currency are Health, Insurance, Supply chain management etc. On the other hand, Artificial Intelligence has been seen making steady progress into our lives with many topics like machine learning, facial recognition, navigation, search algorithms, social media, just to name a few. As the blockchain keeps a non-destroyable record of the transactions onto the decentralized network, artificial intelligence could be developed to learn the transactions in the blockchain and detect the consequences in the future, rather than use/create artificial intelligence on centralized servers with the help of machine learning. To summarize, the intention of the workshop will be to prove that a Blockchain-based decentralized decision making and learning processes are expected to improve the accuracy and efficacy of the results than the ones based on conventional centralized decision making and learning processes.\r The workshop welcomes original research, related idea, and innovative solutions and focus on either fundamental methodological studies or use cases and application demonstrations.

The Italian peninsula, together with the whole Central Mediterranean area, have been impacted significantly over the last few decades. Extreme weather events have caused serious damage, while climate processes have impacted health and ecosystems, creating new risks determined not only by weather events but also by changing exposures and vulnerabilities. Several coastal zones face disasters, including flooding and erosion, and the salinization of river deltas and aquifers that sustain food security and livelihoods. Indeed, the Italian mountains continue to become warmer and drier. Again, for the Central Mediterranean, several models foresee further warming, droughts, and long-lasting modifications. What will the physical geographical consequences be based on current trends and forecasting?\r This Special Issue aims to invite scholars to submit research on the physical impacts of climate change on the Italian peninsula as well as the whole Central Mediterranean area.

The increasing temperatures at the poles are amplified by warmer oceans causing ice melt and rising sea levels, leading to lower oxygen in ocean habitats and killing coral reefs. The extreme coral bleaching event of 2016 resulted in a loss of approximately one-third of shallow-water coral cover in Australia\xe2\x80\x99s Great Barrier Reef. The combination of warming atmosphere and oceans is altering rainfall patterns, affecting the sustainability of a wide range of ecosystems. Dry rivers and streams in southeast Australia during a recent drought resulted in mass fish deaths in southeast Australia, and further fish deaths occurred in recent river surges from flooding rains that mixed with toxic water caused by algal blooms.\r In summary, global warming is already leading to dramatic changes in the Australian climate, with impacts on ecosystems and most aspects of human health, economic activity and wellbeing.\r This Special Issue welcomes all studies related to climate change impacts in Australia.\r Dr. Milton S.

Studies on climate change impacts on extreme climate such as flood and drought are able to adapt and reduce their potential damages. The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) recently released a new climate simulation from The Coupled Model Intercomparison Project Phase 6 (CMIP6), which is an updated version of the general circulation model (GCM). This new CMIP6 GCM is expected to be an improvement of the projection of future climate. The CMIP6 has designed new scenarios called shared socioeconomic pathways (SSP) to include socioeconomic factors such as the growth of population, economics, urbanization, and other factors into climate simulation. This Special Issue aims to collect original studies and reviews as outcomes from CMIP6 climate datasets on water resources and extreme climate.\r Dr. Oeurng Chantha\rDr. Try Sophal\rDr. Sok Ty\rGuest Editors\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157175"">DFM 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Workshop on Data-Flow Models for extreme-scale computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155283"">MODELS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMODELS 2022 : ACM/IEEE 25th International Conference on Model Driven Engineering Languages and Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154684"">ADMA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Advanced Data Mining and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158575"">PRICAI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158794"">SI PMABD 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpecial Issue on Programming Models and Algorithms for Big Data\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161209"">SI CFP IEEE OJ-COMS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIntelligent Communication and Perceptual of Smart City Towards 6G: Emerging Trends and Challenges\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159450"">ACITY 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Advances in Computing and Information Technology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=133735"">ISEM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe International Society for Ecological Modelling Global Conference 2022: Ecological Models for Tomorrow\xe2\x80\x99s Solutions\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159350"">ICIAE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n The 11th IIAE International Conference on Industrial Application Engineering 2023\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153586"">CFP IJFMA Vol 8 No 1 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nNEW DEADLINE !!

For the world's most services-oriented economy, its  services sectors account for more than 90% of GDP. Currently, most of the services are traditional services (e.g. restaurant, travel, transportation, etc.) and digital services (e.g. Internet services, mobile services, digital transformation enabled services, etc.). With the emergence of Metaverse, the current services will be gradually transformed into immersive services that construct digital worlds and connect with physical worlds. The immersive services are the core characteristics of metaverse. \r To rapidly respond to the changing economy, the 2022 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2022) has been naturally extended to become the International Conference on Metaverse (METAVERSE 2022) to cover immersive services for all vertical industries and area solutions. puts its focus on the industry-specific services for digital transformation. Part of the SCF 2018, SERVICES 2018 was successfully held on June 25 - June 30, 2018, Seattle, USA. Part of the SCF 2019, SERVICES 2019 was successfully held on June 25 - 30, 2019, San Diego, USA. Part of the SCF 2020, SERVICES 2020 and SERVICES 2021 was successfully held over the Internet. In 2022, we will celebrate our 2022 version of gathering, to strive to advance the largest international professional forum on industry services research and practices.\r METAVERSE 2022 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2022 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2022 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2022), 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2022), 2022 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2022), and 2022 International Conference on Metaverse (METAVERSE 2022), 2022 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2022), 2022 International conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2022), and 2022 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2022). \r  As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe 2003) was held in Germany in October 2003. ICWS-Europe'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), which was held at Erfurt, Germany. \r Sponsored by Services Society and Springer, SCF 2018 and SCF 2019 were held successfully in Seattle and San Diego, USA.

Despite the prevalent use of fully automated machine learning methods, expert-based methods and their combination with machine learning methods still play an important role in decision-making as they try to bind two worlds in decision-making, the expert based and the data based.\r With soft computing methods and tools one can exploit domain knowledge about the problem at hand, model uncertainty, and imprecision in measurements robustly and with low computation cost. By doing this one enhances the context of the decision-making process and offers comprehensiveness (greater interpretability and explainability) of the decision being made.\r This session aims to present state-of-the-art research on soft computing and optimization, and its application to either expert- or algorithmic-based decision making. Having this in mind, we solicit submissions in all aspects of soft computing and optimization for decision-making, from mathematical foundations of soft computing and optimization for decision-making, novel approaches and methods, and its applications for business purposes or for proposing solutions for social problems.\r ----------\rTopics of interest in this session are presented in the following non-exhaustive list:\r- Soft computing;\r- Fuzzy logic, fuzzy sets and systems and their extensions;\r- Fuzzy decision-making and decision support systems;\r- Fuzzy optimization;\r- Optimization methods and applications for decision-making;\r- Multi-criteria decision-making;\r- Soft computing and optimization in data mining and machine learning;\r- Soft computing and optimization for social good;\r- Multi-objective optimization;\r- Mathematical theory for modeling uncertainty;\r- Decision making under uncertainty;\r- Approximate reasoning, and others.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146828"">NLPTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on NLP Techniques and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158577"">ICAISC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=144117"">CIRSY  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Circuits and Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162557"">ICOICC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Conference on Innovative Strategies in Intelligent Computing and Communication (ICOICC - 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159712"">OnlineMarketplaces 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nKDD 2022 Workshop on Decision Intelligence and Analytics for Online Marketplaces: Jobs, Ridesharing, Retail, and Beyond\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149056"">BIOS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Bioinformatics &amp; Biosciences \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158866"">PDADS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPDADS-2022 Second International Workshop on Parallel and Distributed Algorithms for Decision Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150581"">ACII 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nAdvanced Computational Intelligence: An International Journal\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

These solutions aim to find new ways to obtain a better integration of information technology in everyday life devices and activities.\rAmI environments are integrated by several autonomous computational devices of modern life ranging from consumer electronics to mobile phones. Ideally, people in an AmI environment will not notice these devices, but they will benefit from the services these solutions provide them. Such devices are aware of the people present in those environments by reacting to their gestures, actions and context. Recently the interest in AmI environments has grown considerably due to new challenges posed by society, demanding highly innovative services, such as vehicular ad hoc networks (VANET), Ambient Assisted Living (AAL), e-Health, Internet of Things and Home Automation among others. The main focus of this edition of the UCAmI Conference will be ""Ambient Intelligence: Sensing, Processing and Using Environmental Information"".\r All accepted papers will be included in Proceedings published by Springer.

PRDC is recognized as the main event in the Pacific area that covers many dimensions of dependability and fault tolerance, encompassing fundamental theoretical approaches, practical experimental projects, and commercial components and systems. As applications of computing systems have permeated into all aspects of daily life, the dependability of computing systems has become increasingly critical. This symposium provides a forum for countries around the Pacific Rim and other areas of the world to exchange ideas for improving the dependability of computing systems.\rTopics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Software and hardware reliability, resilience, safety, security, testing,\rverification, and validation\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Dependability measurement, modeling, evaluation, and tools\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Self-healing, self-protecting, and fault-tolerant systems\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Architecture and system design for dependability\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Prognostics in Complex Systems\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Reliability analysis of Complex Systems\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Fault-tolerant algorithms and protocols\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Cloud computing resiliency, security and privacy\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Software defined networks architectures and protocols\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Dependability issues in computing systems (e.g. computer networks and\rcommunications, high performance computing, real-time systems, storage and databases systems, cyber-physical systems, socio-technical systems, and blockchain and smart contracts).\r\xe2\x80\xa2 Emerging technologies (autonomous systems including autonomous vehicles, human machine teaming, smart devices/Internet of Things)\rSubmission and Publication Information\rManuscripts may be submitted in IEEE double-column format to one of the following two categories: (i) Regular Papers and (ii) Practical Experience Reports.\rRegular Papers (10 pages, excluding references and appendices) should describe original research (not submitted or published elsewhere).\rPractical Experience Reports (6 pages, excluding references and appendices) should describe an experience or a case study, such as the design and deployment of a system or actual failure and recovery field data.\rAll submissions must be made electronically (in PDF format) through the submission website. Please note that all submissions will undergo a double-blind review. Please ensure that you have removed any references that could lead to the disclosure of the authors' identities. Failing to do so may result in rejection of the paper regardless of the paper contributions. Papers will be reviewed by program committee members from the international community and selected based on their originality, significance, relevance, and clarity of presentation. All accepted papers will be published by the IEEE Computer Society Press (EI Indexed). Submission of a contribution to the track indicates agreement to have one author present the work, if accepted, at the conference. In light of the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, virtual presentation and attendance options will be available to accommodate all participants.\rOne outstanding paper will be selected to receive the Best Paper Award, and one outstanding paper first-authored by a student will receive the Best Student Paper Award. A few excellent papers will be recommended to have their extended versions submitted to IEEE Transactions on Dependable and Secure Computing (TDSC) or a Special Issue of the Software Testing, Verification and Reliability (STVR) journal.\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158575"">PRICAI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Pacific Rim International Conference on Artificial Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165791"">DSN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163498"">IEEE ICCCBDA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 the 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166548"">ICCSN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 15th International Conference on Communication Software and Networks (ICCSN 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163497"">ICCCBDA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 the 8th International Conference on Cloud Computing and Big Data Analytics (ICCCBDA 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166561"">CCAI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2023 3rd International Conference on Computer Communication and Artificial Intelligence (CCAI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158534"">PSIVT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPacific-Rim Symposium on Image and Video Technology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155978"">IEEE ICA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 6th IEEE International Conference on Agents\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152340"">IEEE SSCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Software-Defined Networking and Network Function Virtualization, 5th Generation and beyond mobile communication technologies, Industry/Society 5.0 and beyond are the major emerging paradigms as well as drivers of change to build smart and sustainable society. Every government has to adapt their policies to address the technological changes and effectively implement policies towards smart service provisioning. Smart city believes in the smartness of everything that are directly related to smart service provisioning to citizens from the local level of government to the central government, which understands the dynamics of changes in the people\xe2\x80\x99s living standards and acts and adapts as a smart government. This means that smart cities need to find new ways to interact with businesses, thought-leaders, suppliers, residents, and visitors. Greater transparency and frequent, two-way communication are expected with the co-creation of public services allowing for greater innovation. Advances in data science allow relevant, real-time data to be transformed into useful information to understand urban behavior and infrastructure needs. This can support evidence-based decision-making, automated responses and autonomously managed procedures. Realizing this potential, however, raises concerns about privacy and security issues, the resilience of critical information infrastructures, and the unintended consequences as social expectations and behaviors are shaped by algorithms. In this regard, it is crucial for smart cities to provide trustworthy services which are secure, privacy-aware and sustainable. Our aim is to promote the development of secure and sustainable smart cities with smart governance.\r ***\rGeneral Chair\rDanda B Rawat\rHoward University\r Technical Program Committee Chairs\rKayhan Zrar Ghafoor\rSalahaddin University-Erbil\r Babu R.

Hence, the sub-Planckian order promises profound consequences, not just for foundational (meta)physics, but also for cosmic evolution in quantum cosmology and human knowledge of it.    \rMany scholars have explored these ideas, most notably the physicists David Bohm and Carlo Rovelli, and within the tradition of relational and process philosophy (Peirce, Bergson, Whitehead, Derrida, Deleuze, Guattari, DeLanda, et al.).  \rThe session invites papers to discuss historical and current positions towards a genuinely holistic philosophia naturalis, which unites philosophy and science beyond the traditional rational-empirical academic disciplinary boundaries.   \r Please send your abstract (300-500 words) to Elize Bisanz \xe2\x80\x93 elize.bisanz@ttu.edu\xe2\x80\x94 by July 30th, 2022. \r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157208"">MEDS  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Conference on Medical Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158595"">MAPACA  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCFP: Mid-Atlantic Popular &amp; American Culture Association (MAPACA) -- 2022 Annual Conference \xe2\x80\x93 Princeton, NJ \xe2\x80\x93 Nov. 10-12, 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149404"">IJITMC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe International Journal of Information Technology, Modeling and Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167353"">SWPACA: EOM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEsotericism, Occultism, and Magic at Southwest Popular/American Culture Association annual conference, Feb 22-25, 2023, Albuquerque, New Mexico\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149161"">PJA Vol. 68 (1) 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPostsocialist Affectivity and Intersectional Feminism\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149399"">NAACL 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 Annual Conference of the North American Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155312"">PBIJ 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPharmaceutical and Biomedical sciences: An International Journal\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164099"">DBA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCFP 2022 Dress and Body Association Conference (November 5-6, 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155293"">NIHILISM SEEN THROUGH THE LENS OF POST-C 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCALL FOR SUBMISSIONS for a topical issue of Open Philosophy NIHILISM SEEN THROUGH THE LENS OF POST-CONTINENTAL PHILOSOPHY\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160471"">East Asian Pop Culture: MPCA/ACA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEast Asian Popular Culture: Midwest Popular Culture Association/Midwest American Culture Association\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

It has also become a growing research area that offers greater security and convenience solutions for various applications in biometrics and forensics areas.\r Methods and algorithms from data science are widely explored and used to address several problems in many fields such as biometrics and forensics. In this context, the advances in artificial intelligence, in particular in feature engineering and deep learning, have allowed to resolve various complex problems related to recognition, detection, control, security, forensic identification, etc.\r Indeed, most of biometric systems are based on a typical representation, including biometric data preprocessing, feature extraction, and classification parts. Deep learning offers an end-to-end learning paradigm allowing to unify these parts. It has been shown to be a promising and powerful alternative to conventional approaches based on machine learning.\r This special session aims to bring together researchers, scientists and industry professionals interested in biometrics and forensic, to present and discuss their recent advanced algorithms and methods in deep learning for biometrics and its applications.\r Topics\r The main topics that are of interest to this special session include, but are not limited to, the following:\r     - Deep learning for biometrics and/or forensics\r    - Biometric recognition (authentication and identification)\r    - Physiological and behavioral biometrics (e.g., fingerprint, palmprint, palm vein, face, iris, ear, gait, voice, etc.)\r    - Soft biometrics\r    - Multimodal biometrics\r    - Big Data challenges in biometrics\r    - Attacks to biometric systems\r    - Security and privacy in biometrics\r    - Forensic identification\r    - Emerging biometrics\r     - Related applications\r Important Dates\r     - Paper submission deadline: June 15, 2022\r    - Paper acceptance notification: August 15, 2022\r    - Conference: November 22-26, 2022 \xe2\x80\x93 New Delhi, India\r Submission Guidelines\r Papers submitted to this Special Session are reviewed according to the same rules as the submissions to the regular sessions of ICONIP 2022.

PDSW'22 will be hosted in conjunction with SC22: The International Conference for High Performance Computing, Networking, Storage and Analysis.\r Efficient data storage and data management are crucial to scientific productivity in both traditional simulation-oriented HPC environments and Big Data analysis environments. This issue is further exacerbated by the growing volume of experimental and observational data, the widening gap between the performance of computational hardware and storage hardware, and the emergence of new data-driven algorithms in machine learning. The goal of this workshop is to facilitate research that addresses the most critical challenges in scientific data storage and data processing. PDSW will continue to build on the successful tradition established by its predecessor workshops: the Petascale Data Storage Workshop (PDSW, 2006-2015) and the Data Intensive Scalable Computing Systems (DISCS 2012-2015) workshop. These workshops were successfully combined in 2016, and the resulting joint workshop has attracted up to 38 full paper submissions and 140 attendees per year from 2016 to 2021. \r We encourage the community to submit original manuscripts that:\r- introduce and evaluate novel algorithms or architectures,\r- inform the community of important scientific case studies or workloads, or\r- validate the reproducibility of previously published work\r Special attention will be given to issues in which community collaboration is crucial for problem identification, workload capture, solution interoperability, standardization, and shared tools.  We also strongly encourage papers to share complete experimental environment information (software version numbers, benchmark configurations, etc.) to facilitate collaboration. \r Topics of interest include the following: \r- Scalable architectures for distributed data storage, archival, and virtualization \r- The application of new data processing models and algorithms towards scientific computing and analysis \r- Performance benchmarking, resource management, and workload studies\r- Enabling cloud and container-based models for scientific data analysis \r- Techniques for data integrity, availability, reliability, and fault tolerance \r- Programming models and big data frameworks for data intensive computing\r- Hybrid cloud/on-premise data processing\r- Cloud-specific data storage and transit costs and opportunities \r- Programmability of storage systems \r- Data filtering/compressing/reduction techniques \r- Parallel file systems, metadata management, and complex data management\r- Integrating computation into the memory and storage hierarchy to facilitate in-situ and in-transit data processing \r- Alternative data storage models, including object stores and key-value stores \r- Productivity tools for data intensive computing, data mining, and knowledge discovery\r- Tools and techniques for managing data movement among compute and data intensive components \r- Cross-cloud data management \r- Storage system optimization and data analytics with machine learning\r- Innovative techniques and performance evaluation for new memory and storage systems\r   Regular Paper Submissions \r-------------------------------------- \rAll papers will be evaluated by a competitive peer review process under the supervision of the workshop program committee. Selected papers and associated talk slides will be made available on the workshop web site. The papers will also be published by the IEEE Computer Society.\r Authors of regular papers are strongly encouraged to submit Artifact Description (AD) Appendices that can help to reproduce and validate their experimental results. While the inclusion of the AD Appendices is optional for PDSW\xe2\x80\x9922, submissions that are accompanied by AD Appendices will be given favorable consideration for the PDSW Best Paper award. \r PDSW\xe2\x80\x9922 follows the SC22 Reproducibility Initiative. For Artifact Description (AD) Appendices, we will use the format of the SC22 for PDSW'22 submissions. The AD should include a field for one or more links to data (zenodo, figshare, etc.) and code (github, gitlab, bitbucket, etc.) repositories. For the Artifacts that will be placed in the code repository, we encourage authors to follow the guidelines of SC22 on how to structure the artifact, as it will make it easier to the reviewing committee and readers of the paper in the future.\r Submit a not previously published paper as a PDF file, indicate authors and affiliations. Papers must be up to 5 pages, not less than 10 point font and not including references and optional reproducibility appendices. Papers must use the IEEE conference paper template available at: https://www.ieee.org/conferences/publishing/templates.html\r  Work-in-progress (WIP) Submissions\r--------------------------------------------------\rThere will be a WIP session where presenters provide brief 5-minute talks (TBD) on their on-going work, with fresh problems/solutions. WIP content is typically material that may not be mature or complete enough for a full paper submission and will not be included in the proceedings. A one-page abstract is required.\r  Important Dates\r----------------------\rRegular Papers and Reproducibility Study Papers:\rSubmissions due: Aug. 13, 2022, 11:59 PM AoE\rPaper Notification: \xc2\xa0 Sep. 9, 2022\rCamera ready due: \xc2\xa0Sep. 30, 2022, 11:59 PM AoE\r Work in Progress (WIP):\rSubmissions due: \xc2\xa0Sep. 16, 2022, 11:59PM AoE\rWIP Notification: \xc2\xa0On or before Sep. 23, 2022\r  Workshop Organizers\r------------------------------\rGeneral Chair\r- Kento Sato, RIKEN R-CCS, Japan\r Program Co-Chairs\r- Amelie Chi Zhou, Shenzhen University, China \xc2\xa0\r- Bing Xie, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, USA \xc2\xa0\r Publicity Chair\r- Jean Luca Bez, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, USA\r Web and Proceedings Chair\r- Joan Digney, Carnegie Mellon University\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166827"">SDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSDM 2023 : SIAM International Conference on Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163215"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n19th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152340"">IEEE SSCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=118179"">DMKD 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 6th International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery(DMKD 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167676"">IEEE CCNC STP-CPS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Workshop on Security Trust Privacy for Cyber-Physical Systems (STP-CPS\'23) with IEEE CCNC 2023, 8-11 January, Las Vegas, NV, USA\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Consequently, the development of such systems requires the integration of different concerns and skills. These concerns can be covered by different domain-specific modeling languages, with specific concepts, technologies, and abstraction levels. This multiplication of languages eases the development related to each individual specific concern but raises language and technology integration problems at the different stages of the software life cycle. To reason about the global system as a whole, it is necessary to explicitly describe the different kinds of relationships that exist between the different languages used in its development. To support effective language integration, there is a pressing need to reify and classify these relationships, as well as the language interactions that the relationships enable. Equally, the proliferation of domain-specific modeling languages required increases the need for effective and efficient techniques for engineering languages and their support infrastructures (transformations, analysis tools, editors, execution infrastructure, debuggers, \xe2\x80\xa6).\r The Modeling Language Engineering (MLE) workshop aims at bringing together researchers and practitioners working on modeling-language and software-language engineering. It is a meeting opportunity for Software Language Engineering (SLE) enthusiasts within the software-modeling community.\r ---------------------------\rTopics\r---------------------------\r The topics of interest for MLE 2022 include:\r  - Methodologies, languages, techniques, and methods for designing and implementing modeling languages\r- Composition, extension, and reuse of modeling languages and model execution tools\r- Heterogeneous modeling, simulation, and execution\r- Customization of modeling languages\r- Integration of modeling languages and programming languages\r- Semantics-aware model transformations and code generation\r- Scalability of model execution and execution-based model analysis\r- Execution of partial and underspecified models\r- Model execution in the presence of non-determinism and concurrency\r- Tracing model executions and analyzing model execution traces\r- Model execution tools for the (dynamic) validation, verification, and testing of systems (e.g., model animation, debugging, simulation, trace exploration, model checking, symbolic execution)\r- Live modeling and exploratory modeling techniques\r- Automation techniques for the development of modeling and model execution tools\r- Evolution in the context of executable modeling (e.g.} evolution of executable modeling languages, execution semantics, executable models, model execution tools)\r- Verification of semantic conformance (e.g., among executable modeling languages, executable models, model execution tools)\r- Integration challenges for languages, from requirements to design, for analysis and simulation, during runtime, etc.\r- Case studies and experience reports on the successful or failed adoption of modeling in different application domains and application contexts\r- Surveys and benchmarks of different approaches for the development of modeling languages, model execution, and execution-based model analysis\r Submissions describing practical and industrial experience related to the use of modeling languages are also encouraged, particularly in the following application domains:\rCyber-Physical Systems, Smart Manufacturing, Industry 4.0;  Internet of Services, Internet of Things; Smart City, Smart Building, Home automation; Smart and Learning systems.\r ---------------------------\rWorkshop Format\r---------------------------\r This full-day workshop will prioritize discussions over presentations. We plan to open with a keynote in the morning, followed by paper presentations. The afternoon will then be spent primarily in discussions inspired by topics raised by the keynotes and paper presentations.  Where there is sufficient divergence in the topics raised, we will create break-out groups of participants interested in each sub-topic. The goal of these discussions is to identify commonalities and connections between different topics, support research networking, cross-pollination, and informal knowledge transfer. The final session of the workshop will be focused on summarising the key topics and ideas discussed at the workshop to help identify the next steps that may be followed up by workshop participants.\r  ---------------------------\rSubmission and Publication\r---------------------------\r We expect early research results about the aforementioned topics, descriptions of problems, case studies, experience reports, or solutions related to the topics of interest.\r Each contribution must be described in a short paper of 5 pages or a full paper of 10 pages, in ACM format (acmart). Two more pages containing only references are permitted.\r Papers that describe use cases or novel approaches can be accompanied by concrete artifacts, such as models (requirements, design, analysis, transformation, composition, etc.), stored in a public repository. Artifacts should illustrate any experience with the conjoint use of different modeling languages.\r All submissions have to follow the ACM format (acmart) and must be submitted electronically in PDF format [via Easychair](https://easychair.org/my/conference?conf=mle2022). They will be evaluated by at least three members of the program committee regarding novelty, correctness, significance, readability, and alignment with the workshop call. Furthermore, all submissions must be original work and must not have been previously published or being under review elsewhere. The accepted papers will be included in the joint workshop proceedings published in the ACM Digital Library and indexed in DBLP and Scopus.\r   ---------------------------\rImportant Dates\r---------------------------\r - Abstract submission deadline: July 13, 2022\r- Paper submission deadline: July 20, 2022\r- Notification of acceptance: August 19, 2022\r- Camera-ready deadline: August 26, 2022\r  ---------------------------\rOrganization committee\r---------------------------\r  - Erwan Bousse (Nantes University)\r- Faezeh Khorram (IMT Atlantique)\r- Juha-Pekka Tolvanen (MetaCase)\r  ---------------------------\rProgram Committee\r---------------------------\r TBA\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156554"">IEEE ICSTE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2022 12th International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering (ICSTE 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152145"">MLDS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on Machine Learning Techniques and Data Science\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162766"">ICCES--EI, Scopus 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 29th International Conference on Computational &amp; Experimental Engineering and Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152067"">AISO 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156614"">Mathematics (MDPI) 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMathematics Special Issue - Analysis and Mathematical Modeling of Control Engineering and Path Planning\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156556"">IEEE--ISCMI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2022 9th Intl.

Submissions should be no more than 12 pages in the ACM double-column format, excluding the bibliography and well-marked appendix. Committee members are not required to read the appendices, and so the paper should be intelligible without them. Submissions should not be anonymized. The workshop will also consider short submissions of up to 4 pages for results that are preliminary or that simply require few pages to describe. Authors of regular submitted papers will indicate at the time of submission whether they would like their paper to also be considered for publication as a short paper (4 proceedings pages).\r Submissions are to be made to the submission website at EasyChair. Only PDF files will be accepted. Submissions not meeting these guidelines risk rejection without consideration of their merits. Papers must be received by the deadline of July 16, 2022 (11:59 PM American Samoa time) to be considered. Notification of acceptance or rejection will be sent to authors by August 31, 2022.\r Authors of accepted papers must guarantee that their paper will be presented at the workshop.\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157177"">NordSec 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 27th Nordic Conference on Secure IT Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165775"">WPES 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDeadline Extended: 21st Workshop on Privacy in the Electronic Society\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165178"">ACNS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n21st International Conference on Applied Cryptography and Network Security\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150592"">EvoCompAISecurity&amp;Privacy 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEvolutionary Computing for AI-Driven Security and Privacy: Advancing the state-of-the-art applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167676"">IEEE CCNC STP-CPS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Workshop on Security Trust Privacy for Cyber-Physical Systems (STP-CPS\'23) with IEEE CCNC 2023, 8-11 January, Las Vegas, NV, USA\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157122"">SPACE  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Security, Privacy and Applied Cryptographic Engineering (SPACE 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163221"">IEEE PriComp 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 2022 IEEE International Conference on Privacy Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155829"">Electronics SI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n Electronics: Special Issue on Cybersecurity and Privacy Issues in Cyber-Physical Systems and Industrial Control Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163030"">CyberHunt 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE BigData Workshop on Cyber Threat Intelligence and Hunting\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166252"">EICC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEuropean Interdisciplinary Cybersecurity Conference (EICC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Together with both earlier  and later collaborations\rwith Robert Kowalski  and his colleagues in Edinburgh,  this work laid\rthe practical  and theoretical  foundations for  the Prolog  and logic\rprogramming of today. Prolog and  its related technologies soon became\rkey tools of symbolic programming and Artificial Intelligence.\r The Year of Prolog celebrates the 50th anniversary of these events and\rhighlights the continuing significance of Prolog and Logic Programming\rboth for symbolic, explainable AI, and for computing more generally.\r This  celebration  will culminate  with  the  award of  the  inaugural\redition of the  ALP Alain Colmerauer Prolog Heritage  Prize for recent\rpractical   accomplishments    that   highlight   the    benefits   of\rProlog-inspired computing for the future.  The Prize will be presented\rat the Prolog Day Symposium on November 10, 2022, in Paris, France.\r Eligibility\r-----------\rAny  individual or  group of  individuals can  nominate themselves  or\rtheir institution(s)/organization(s) for the Prize.\r Selection\r---------\rThe Prize  will be given for  depth, novelty, and proven  or potential\rimpact.

This phenomenon has been extensively studied for more than 20 years, as it affects many systems, from embedded devices to server software to critical systems. \r Software rejuvenation, i.e., proactive restart of applications (components/threads/tasks), reboot of VMs or machines, and failover to a replica are the most prominent approach es to combat software aging.

Several resources for languages are not available in their human-created format. Some of the types of resources available are monolingual, multilingual, translation memories, and lexicons. Those types of resources are generally created for formal purposes such as parliamentary collections when parallel and more informal situations when monolingual. The quality and abundance of resources including corpora used for formal reasons is generally higher than those used for informal purposes. Additionally, corpora for low-resource languages, languages with less digital resources available, tends to be less abundant and of lower quality.\r CoCo4MT sets out to be the first workshop centered around research that focuses on corpora creation, cleansing, and augmentation techniques specifically for machine translation. We accept work that covers any spoken language (including high-resource languages) but we are specifically interested in those submissions that are on languages with limited existing resources (low-resource languages) where resources are not highly available. \r The goal of this workshop is to begin to close the gap between corpora available for low-resource translation systems and promote high-quality data for online systems that can be used by native speakers of low-resource languages is of particular interest. Therefore, It will be beneficial if the techniques presented in research papers include their impact on the quality of MT output and how they can be used in the real world.\r CoCo4MT aims to encourage research on new and undiscovered techniques. We hope that submissions will provide high-quality corpora that is available publicly for download and can be used to increase machine translation performance thus encouraging new dataset creation for multiple languages that will, in turn, provide a general workshop to consult for corpora needs in the future. The workshop\xe2\x80\x99s success will be measured by the following key performance indicators:\r - Promotes the ongoing increase in quality of machine translation systems when measured by standard measurements,\r- Provides a meeting place for collaboration from several research areas to increase the availability of commonly used corpora and new corpora,\r- Drives innovation to address the need for higher quality and abundance of low-resource language data.\r TOPICS\r We are highly interested in original research papers  on the topics below; however, we welcome all novel ideas that cover research on corpora techniques.\r - Difficulties with using existing corpora (e.g., political considerations or domain limitations) and their effects on final MT systems,\r- Strategies for collecting new MT datasets (e.g., via crowdsourcing),\r- Data augmentation techniques,\r- Data cleansing and denoising techniques, \r- Quality control strategies for MT data,\r- Exploration of datasets for pretraining or auxiliary tasks for training MT systems.\r SUBMISSION INFORMATION\r There is one type of submission in the workshop:  Research, review and position paper. The length of each paper should be at least four (4) and not exceed ten (10) pages, plus unlimited pages for references. Submissions should be formatted according to the official AMTA 2022 style templates (PDF, LaTeX, Word). Accepted papers will be published on-line in the AMTA 2022 proceedings which includes the ACL Anthology and will be presented at the conference either orally or as a poster. \r Submissions must be anonymized and should be done using the official conference management system (https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AMTA2022). Scientific papers that have been or will be submitted to other venues must be declared as such, and must be withdrawn from the other venues if accepted and published at CoCo4MT. The review will be double-blind. \r We would like to encourage authors to cite papers written in ANY language that are related to the topics, as long as both original bibliographic items and their corresponding English translations are provided.\r Registration will be handled by the main conference.

In fact, this can get even more complex in regards to the new challenges imposed by new digital technologies and the different ways of interacting. In this context, textual-discursive aspects can come to materialize, assuming great relevance. Thus, considering the relevance of this topic in the current studies of Language Sciences, Entrepalavras invites researchers, scholars, and professors to submit unpublished contributions in the various areas of language studies and other related areas of knowledge, to be published on its thematic issue: Multimodality in Social Practices. This issue aims to disseminate articles and research that focus on the various textual-discursive studies dealing with multimodality in its various social manifestations.\r Timetable: \r Submission deadline: August 31, 2022. \r Publication: December, 2022. \n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=95801"">ICAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n10th International Conference on Asian Studies 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164999"">MS - 22/2 (2022) 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCfP: International Studies journal (Winter 2022, including special thematic interest: International Relations after 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165000"">AET 8/2  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCfP: Acta Economica Et Turistica journal (8/2, 2022), including special thematic interests\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165462"">ICLMC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 11th International Conference on Language, Media and Culture (ICLMC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157123"">AITS@EPIA  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nArtificial Intelligence in Transportation Systems (Thematic Track at EPIA2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163165"">ICHC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 The 9th International Conference on History and Culture (ICHC 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157124"">MASTA@EPIA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMultiAgent Systems: Theory and Applications (Thematic Track at EPIA2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155761"">ICDLL 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Discourse, Language and Literature\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153589"">CompHealth 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nComputational Health Thematic Track at ICCS 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161198"">ICLLL 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 12th International Conference on Languages, Literature and Linguistics (ICLLL 2022)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Our goal is to have a program of workshops and tutorials that appeals to the various constituents of the MT community (researchers, developers, commercial users, and language professionals). Therefore, we welcome not only proposals on deeply technical research and development topics but also on, for instance, the collection and curation of training data, best practices in training MT systems, human/computer interaction among translators, interpreters, and other users of MT output, and the evolving role of translation automation in the commercial translation production pipeline. \r Tutorials and Workshops will be held on Monday, September 12, immediately preceding the main conference, and Friday, September 16, immediately following the main conference.\r Tutorials\rTutorials are a forum for experts in MT and MT-related areas to deliver concentrated training on a topic of interest in half-day teaching sessions. Tutorials help conference participants enrich their understanding of specific technical, applied, and business matters surrounding research, development, and use of MT and associated technologies, or, in the case of tutorials designed for newcomers, provide background information that facilitates greater understanding of the overall conference program.\r Proposals for tutorials should be submitted by June 13, 2022, to tutorials@amtaweb.org and include: \r the title\ra 250-500 word description of the proposed content\ra short ((100 words) biographical introduction to the proposed presenter(s)\rany technical requirements you may have\rand a scanned signed copy of the Tutorial Policy and Leader Agreement Form.  \rWorkshops\rAMTA workshops are intended to provide the opportunity for MT-related communities of interest to spend focused time together advancing the state of thinking or the state of practice in their area of interest or endeavor. Workshops are generally scheduled as full-day events.\r Every effort will be made to accept or reject (with reason) workshop proposals as soon as possible after they are received by the organizing committee so that the workshop organizers have adequate time to prepare the workshop.\r We encourage you to submit your proposals for a workshop as early as possible. They should be submitted no later than Friday, May 20, 2022, to workshops@amtaweb.org and include: \r the title\ra 250-500 word description of the proposed content\rwhether this is an ongoing or new workshop\ra short ((100 words) biographical introduction to the proposed presenter(s)\rthe expected number of participants\rand dates for important milestones (call for papers, recruitment of speakers, etc.)\rany technical requirements you may have\rand a scanned signed copy of the Workshop Policy and Leader Agreement Form.\rWe look forward to receiving your proposal!\r \n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158291"">ICNLSP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Conference on  Natural Language  and Speech Processing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152256"">IJCNN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Joint Conference on Neural Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146740"">ACL 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n60th Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155978"">IEEE ICA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 6th IEEE International Conference on Agents\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163215"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n19th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167718"">CVPR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe IEEE/CVF Conference on Computer Vision and Pattern Recognition\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161159"">ICMLT--Ei, Scopus 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 8th International Conference on Machine Learning Technologies (ICMLT 2023)--EI Compendex, Scopus\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165754"">Distributed ML and Opt. 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDistributed Machine Learning and Optimization: Theory and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158597"">AACL-IJCNLP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 2nd Conference of the Asia-Pacific Chapter of the Association for Computational Linguistics and the 12th International Joint Conference on Natural Language Processing\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

But far from being a curious datum of human existence, diversity has emerged as a key disquiet for many societies at the turn of the new century. Yet the meaning attached to this expression are varied and shifting especially the differences that caused many to lose sight of the imperative of common humanity which culminates into numerous conflicts and protestations. This arguments corollary is that, given the inherent values and intrinsic functions of diversity in many societies of the world, the multi-cultural, multi-religious, and multi-ethnic configuration of many societies today presents a scenario of acute crisis of identify for which its design is characterized by heightened distinctiveness\xe2\x80\x99 in spirituality, politics, fundamentalism, and cultural intolerance. Specifically, in every society, diversity is often complicated by the considerations of the intersections of gender and religion. Given that religion is particularly shaped by and intertwined with its social context, as well as constructed by social actors through social relations in complex ways, then conversations of the intersectionality of diversity with bias to gender, sex, and religion is also clearly socially located. This social location as well includes spatial location, which is continuously changing geographies and is also linked to shifting demographies with its dynamics of the complex picture of new diversity. Illustratively, religious diversity, for instance, expresses a major way in which people in societies are different and sometimes through its institutional and power structures are enabled to be different. Oftentimes, religious differences help to structure and restructure the stratification system of the society. Religious differences stand in relation to and intersect with other social characteristics in determining power distribution, exclusion, inclusion, recognition, and invisibility in the society. Nonetheless, such intersecting criteria include gender, sex, sexual orientation, race, ethnicity, class, and what one can largely categorize as culture. It must be acknowledged that the boundary between the religious and the not religious in every society is oftentimes fuzzy; with multiple identities co-existing within the same person and frequently layered and intersect with principally gender and sexuality. In rare cases though, the question of flexibility characterized many religious adherents who have no strong religious identity, and are, therefore, susceptible to religion informing their approach to matters of sexuality, including pre-marital sex. This conceptualization of diversity in the world today raises the question of diversity in multidimensional perspectives such as religion, gender, sex, the degree of acceptance in the public sphere, the ideological commitment to values of diversity and the increasing scope of acceptability of multiple layers of diversity in the society. It also interrogates how diversity (especially religious) manifest itself in the society, how it provides sites for political contestation and stratification as well as inclusion and/or exclusion, how it affects other social dimensions, and how to respond to it in the effort toward a more peaceable and just societies which are clearly very complex.\r Objective:\rThe overall objective and mission of this proposed book project shall be to contribute multi-dimensionally toward increasing the pool of knowledge in scholarship.

Hence, the sub-Planckian order promises profound consequences, not just for foundational (meta)physics, but also for cosmic evolution in quantum cosmology and human knowledge of it.    \rMany scholars have explored these ideas, most notably the physicists David Bohm and Carlo Rovelli, and within the tradition of relational and process philosophy (Peirce, Bergson, Whitehead, Derrida, Deleuze, Guattari, DeLanda, et al.).  \rThe session invites papers to discuss historical and current positions towards a genuinely holistic philosophia naturalis, which unites philosophy and science beyond the traditional rational-empirical academic disciplinary boundaries.   \r Please send your abstract (300-500 words) to Elize Bisanz \xe2\x80\x93 elize.bisanz@ttu.edu\xe2\x80\x94 by July 30th, 2022. \r Conference location:  Hilton Denver City Central in Denver, CO\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=148457"">VLSIE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on VLSI Embedded Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155073"">MSSD 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMaking Sense of Stream Data - special issue of the Journal of Web Semantics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157208"">MEDS  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Conference on Medical Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160685"">Decisioning 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDecisioning 2022: Collaboration in knowledge discovery and decision making: Applications to sustainable agriculture\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149404"">IJITMC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe International Journal of Information Technology, Modeling and Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149407"">Relations.

Having a large number of labeled images helps increase the performance of machine learning models by generalizing better and thereby reducing overfitting. This requirement is even more significant for cutting-edge learning architectures such as vision transformers. As a result, the most popular benchmark datasets for general image recognition tasks have tens of thousands to millions of images.\r Unfortunately, obtaining such vast amounts of labeled data is very challenging in the medical imaging domain due to costly annotation by domain experts and the lack of high-quality anonymized data out of privacy concerns. Furthermore, there are unique challenges to collecting annotated medical datasets. For instance, although hard to obtain, examples of rare pathological conditions are extremely important for an accurate representation of the data distribution. Moreover, there are often variations among experts who provide labels, especially for conditions that human experts are most confused about and need help the most.\r The goal of this workshop is to bring together and create a discussion forum for researchers in the MICCAI community, including those i) who are interested in the rigorous study of medical data as it relates to machine learning systems, ii) who are developing and promoting novel directions of research in such techniques, iii) who would like to contribute benchmark datasets, open challenges, and tasks that enable fair comparisons among existing and new techniques, and iv) who are applying such techniques to improve the performance of medical image computing systems. The workshop will have invited speakers presenting popular and emerging data augmentation and contemporary approaches for learning from small and noisy medical data. The workshop welcomes submissions that present new ideas, new results, new datasets, as well as discussion and evaluation of existing approaches. The topics of interest include but are not limited to:\r * Training and evaluation with noisy or uncertain labels\r* Data annotation tools and practices\r* Synthetic data for medical image analysis\r* One-shot/few-shot learning\r* Active learning\r* Semi-, weakly-, self-supervised learning\r* Deep learning for small, noisy and imperfect data\r* Domain adaptation/generalization\r* Erroneous label detection\r* Data curation\r* Principles and/or case studies of annotated datasets and benchmarks\r* Anonymization, PHI detection\r* Other related topics\r Submissions to our workshop will be managed using the same platform as the main MICCAI 2022 conference, using the Microsoft CMT. Workshop paper submission website is at: https://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/DALI2022\r DALI workshop will employ the same reviewing standards as the main MICCAI conference. DALI workshop paper submissions should be anonymized in order to accommodate a double blind review. Papers should be formatted using LaTeX or MS Word templates available at Lecture Notes in Computer Science. Manuscripts should be up to 8-pages (text, figures and tables) plus up to 2 pages of references. In submitting a paper, authors implicitly acknowledge that no paper of substantially similar content has been or will be submitted to another conference or workshop until the decisions have been made by our workshop. Supplemental material submission is optional, which may include:\r * Videos of results that cannot be included in the main paper\r* Anonymized related submissions to other conferences and journals\r* Appendices or technical reports containing extended proofs and mathematical derivations that are not essential for the understanding of the paper\r Contents of the supplemental material should be referred to appropriately in the paper and that reviewers are not obliged to look at it.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152256"">IJCNN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Joint Conference on Neural Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166827"">SDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSDM 2023 : SIAM International Conference on Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163191"">ECIR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n45th European Conference on Information Retrieval\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164435"">CoCo4MT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2nd CFP - The First Workshop on Corpus Generation and Corpus Augmentation for Machine Translation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146828"">NLPTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on NLP Techniques and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163215"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n19th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152340"">IEEE SSCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 IEEE Symposium Series on Computational Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=118179"">DMKD 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 6th International Conference on Data Mining and Knowledge Discovery(DMKD 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"
