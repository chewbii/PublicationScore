On the one hand, the diffusion of fixed-term contracts, temporary agency work and solo self-employment \xe2\x80\x93 increasingly mediated by digital platforms \xe2\x80\x93 is rapidly multiplying the risk of precariousness for an ever-growing group of workers (Castel 2009; Kalleberg 2009; Vosko 2010). On the other hand, these forms of employment are fostering an unequal integration into the labour market that not only exacerbates traditional gender, class, age and ethnicity divisions (Banks, Milestone 2011; van Doorn 2017), but also further undermines labour\xe2\x80\x99s rights and working conditions as a whole (Choonara et al. 2022), worsening the crisis of social reproduction in neoliberal capitalism (Leonard, Fraser 2016; Zanoni 2019).\r Moreover, such changes have also prompted debates on the adequacy and effectiveness of collective forms of worker representation, given the difficulties faced by unions in dealing with the heterogeneity of work arrangements. Prominent in these debates is the question on how to engage the precarious workers, who have long been considered \xc2\xabun-organizable\xc2\xbb, in the political struggle (Murgia, Selmi 2012; Holgate et al. 2018; Keune, Pedaci 2019). Albeit at a different pace and in different national modalities, trade unions have increasingly recognized the need to address the organization and collective representation of the growing group of precarious workers, to better represent their interests (Doellgast et al. 2018; Simms, Dean 2014; Gumbrell-McCormick 2011; Pernicka 2005). An important aspect of trade union renewal concerns building alliances with societal actors, such as communities and groups, to create counter-hegemonic blocs that revitalise workers\xe2\x80\x99 power. In this process, unions are required to leave the comfort zone of classical industrial relations, to recognize and leverage their common interests with multiple constituencies (Atzeni, Ness 2016; Hyman, Gumbrell-McCormick 2017; Kesselman, Carelli 2020; Meardi et al. 2021; Mezihorak et al. 2022). At the same time, less institutionalised forms of collective mobilization are building new possibilities of resistance against precarization within social movements (Foti 2017; Mattoni 2016; Neilson, Rossiter 2005), as well as within alternative organizations, such as quasi-unions (Heckscher, Carr\xc3\xa9 2006) and cooperatives (Flecha, Ngai 2014; Graceffa, de Heusch 2017; Mondon-Navazo et al. 2021; Scholz, Schneider 2016), which are enacting novel processes that foster collective identity and political engagement.\rThe turbulence of the labour market on the one hand, and the vitality of old and new workers\xe2\x80\x99 organizations on the other suggests renovating the terms of the debate that conceptualizes labour and its forms of mobilizing. This Special Issue contributes to this attempt by proposing the concept of \xc2\xabhybrid areas of work\xc2\xbb to grasp emerging work arrangements and forms of organizing, and challenge the hierarchy encoded in the dichotomies through which the labour market has been interpreted since the Fordist era (Ricciardi 2019). By leveraging the concept of hybridization (Aza\xc3\xafs 2019), the aim is to supersede the polarizations which counterpose \xc2\xabblack\xc2\xbb and \xc2\xabwhite\xc2\xbb, and to move towards a theoretical rethinking of the interpretative categories of work and employment. This will require questioning the historical binary opposition between employment and self-employment, standard and non-standard, formal and informal, paid and unpaid forms of work. In dialogue with the debate on \xc2\xabgrey\xc2\xbb zones of labour and employment and with the studies focused on the blurring of the employment relationship boundaries (Corsani 2020; Bureau et al. 2019; Aza\xc3\xafs et al. 2017; D\xe2\x80\x99Amours et al., 2017; Bureau, Corsani 2015; Freedland 2003; Supiot 1999), we propose to use the concept of \xc2\xabhybrid\xc2\xbb to capture the co-existence of multiple features that cannot be represented in a binary way (Murgia et al. 2020). Framed in these terms, hybridisation is a process that characterises the precarious and fragmented nature of contemporary labour, which is also affecting the level of social protection, as well as at the level of collective representation.\rMoreover, the Special Issue aims at advancing our understanding of how hybrid areas of work and employment are articulated in both the Global North and the Global South. Ulrich Beck (1999), in his pioneering work on the new world of work, pointed out the risk of a \xc2\xabbrazilianisation\xc2\xbb of the Occident. By this he meant that issues related to \xc2\xabinformal sector\xc2\xbb approaches in the Global South could contribute to understanding tendencies in the North, in terms of the privatisation of public services, commodification of social benefits, loss of the influence of the state, etc., according to the Washington Consensus perspective and the Structural Adjustment Policies in the 80\xe2\x80\x99s. Nowadays, recognising that common features exist between Global North and South compels us to examine the new features of labour and employment relationships we have qualified as hybrid forms of work, within a general process of hybridization of labour market statuses, individual careers, and collective forms of representation. \rFurthermore, the Special Issue invites us to dismiss the lenses that conceive contemporary precarious work as the linear result of progressive erosion of \xc2\xabstandard work\xc2\xbb, by focusing on the boundaries outlining the emerging hybrid areas of work (i.e. formal/informal, paid/unpaid, productive/reproductive, leisure/work, production/consumption, etc.), both today and throughout history. Therefore, theoretical and theoretically grounded empirical papers are welcome on the following (but not exclusive) topics:\r \xe2\x80\xa2\tHow can the boundaries of emerging hybrid areas of work be drawn? Challenging traditional dichotomies to investigate the changing nature of work (formal/informal, paid/unpaid, productive/reproductive, leisure/work, production/consumption, etc.)\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe subjective representations of workers and the emergence of hybrid identities in contemporary societies, in both the Global South and Global North\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe hybrid work arrangements in the labour market, and their differences in the global landscape and through time from a socio-historical perspective, also in terms of employment regulation and social protection \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe configuration of hybrid areas of work in terms of gender, family status, migration status, ethnicity, national origin, class, age, skills, and level of education\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tGendered and generational inequalities in hybrid areas of work, focusing on multiple recent crises and their impact on employment expectations and work motivations\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe changing health and well-being conditions of workers experiencing hybrid forms of work\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe blurring boundaries between employment and self-employment: defining new forms of autonomy and dependence\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe rise of digital and platform work: an emerging employment sector or the redefinition of old patterns? \r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe forms of collective representation of workers with a hybrid status and the emergence of hybrid forms of organizing within both traditional and new collective actors (trade unions, employer associations, grassroots groups, cooperatives, etc.)\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tThe theoretical lenses that can be developed to provide more sophisticated analyses of the hybrid areas of work and employment\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tMethodological issues related to the study of hybrid areas of work and employment, as well as proposals to address them (i.e. by questioning official statistics, as well as by experimenting with participatory research methods)\r Deadlines and guidelines\r Abstracts are due by June 15, 2022.

The objective of the conference is to showcase successful applications and novel uses of AI. The conference will use technical papers, best practice papers, invited talks, and panel discussions to explore issues, methods, and lessons learned in the development and deployment of AI applications; and to promote an interchange of ideas between basic and applied AI and the discourse on the actual deployment of AI in practice. The general goal of the conference is to teach people the challenges and solutions to accomplishing something useful in the real world, as opposed to describing a new algorithm. Papers focussing on algorithmic descriptions, rather than applications, are more appropriate for AAAI-23. All submissions must be original.\rIAAI-23 will consider: (1) papers that showcase novel, deployed applications of AI; (2) applications on a trajectory to deployment; (3) papers that present deployed tools for faster AI solutions development and deployment; (4) papers that showcase original ways of integrating methodologies from different areas of AI for practical realization and future deployment; and (5) best practice papers. Submissions should clearly identify which track they are intended for, as the tracks are judged on different criteria. All submissions must be original.\rTracks and Topics\r1. Deployed Highly Innovative Applications of AI\rPapers submitted to this track must describe *deployed* applications with measurable benefits that include an innovative use of AI technology. Applications are defined as deployed once they are in production use by their final end-users and the in-use experience can be meaningfully collected and reported. The study may evaluate either a stand-alone application or a component of a complex system.\rPapers will be judged by the quality of: the task or problem description; the application description; the innovative use of AI technology; the measurable application use and payoff; and the lessons learned during application development, deployment and maintenance. In-depth descriptions of the algorithm are generally more appropriate for AAAI than for IAAI. Each accepted deployed application paper will receive the IAAI \xe2\x80\x98Innovative Application\xe2\x80\x99 Award.\rPapers in this track may have up to 8 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.\r2. Emerging Applications of AI\rEmerging applications papers \xe2\x80\x98bridge the gap\xe2\x80\x99 between basic AI research and case studies of deployed AI applications, by discussing efforts to apply AI tools, techniques, or methods to real-world problems in novel ways. Emerging applications focus on aspects of AI applications that are not yet sufficiently deployed to be submitted as case studies in the Deployed track.\rThis track is distinguished from reports of purely scientific AI research appropriate for AAAI in that the objective of the efforts reported at IAAI should be the potential application of AI technologies, including engineering considerations. A key requirement for papers is to discuss the path forward for achieving deployment of the technology.\rPapers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: significance (of the problem, and the tool or methodology); relevance of AI technology to the problem; innovation; path to deployment; content; evaluation; technical quality; and clarity. Authors are advised to bear these questions in mind while writing their papers. Authors are also advised to consider the novelty of applying AI to the particular problem domain.\rPapers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.\r3. Deployed Innovative Tools for Enabling AI Applications\rWithin this track, we solicit papers describing *deployed* tools for improving applied AI innovation and deployment of AI systems. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to:\r\xef\x82\xb7 Process organization: Tools that help manage and assure the development, evaluation or deployment of AI systems.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Data cleaning: Tools to ease the pain point of processing raw data for its use in AI systems.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Modelling: Tools that facilitate AI modelling, for example approaches to facilitate deriving models from examples or demonstrations.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Meta-algorithmics: Tools to improve AI systems, algorithm configurators, algorithm portfolios, and hyper-parameter tuners.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Platforms: Tools in the form of platforms designed for AI research, especially those with connections to real world systems and domains.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Novel computational models: Tools to exploit new computational hardware, for example neuromorphic co-processors, quantum computers, and chips approximating quantum computation.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Interaction: Tools that facilitate the interaction design of or user experience with AI systems, or improve user evaluations.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Trusted AI: Tools that generate explanations, justifications, and persuasions for data-driven models.\rPapers will be judged primarily by the following criteria: the extent to which the tool presented yields solutions with demonstrated improved quality; lower development, deployment and maintenance costs; better productivity; fewer errors; and higher ability to scale. Reviewers will pay attention to how well designed is the tool, how easy is it to use and how well is it documented, and how many users it has. Note the focus is on the tool, not on foundational research.\rPapers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.\r4. Innovative Inter-disciplinary AI Integration\rThis track is devoted to the integration of AI components with the focus on how the orchestration of methods from different AI silos requires the adaptation of existing technologies to allow them to work together well for application of AI in practice. Papers must pay attention to engineering considerations and, where relevant, to human\xe2\x80\x93computer interaction.\rExamples for such orchestrated new capabilities and applications include but are not limited to:\r\xef\x82\xb7 Learning search algorithms: Implementations of systematic and heuristic search algorithms that are capable to improve their performance by learning from experience or during search.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Decision support under uncertainty: Implementations that combine statistical and deterministic reasoning to provide scalable decision support under uncertainty for applications that are inherently stochastic.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Knowledge representation: Representations that work effectively for downstream analytics, e.g., the innovative use of a knowledge graph for feature generation of a downstream machine learning model.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Auto-configuration: The adaptation of search methods from combinatorial optimization to optimize knowledge bases or to design superior forecasting algorithms.\r\xef\x82\xb7 Other research prototypes that integrate algorithms and methods from traditionally different AI sub-communities.\rA clear, transparent, and reproducible case must be presented that allows the community to judge objectively the value of the innovation of the integration when compared to existing or ad-hoc approaches. Computational experiments on benchmarks (that either already are or will be made public) and in comparison with existing state-of-the-art baseline methods are expected. At least a portion of the experiments is expected to consider real-world (not synthetic generated) benchmarks to demonstrate the practical importance of the problem studied.\rPapers in this track may have up to 6 pages in the prescribed AAAI style, plus at most one more page which may only contain references.\r5. AI Best Practices, Challenge Problems, Training AI Users\rIn this short paper track, we welcome papers that review best practices when deploying AI, that communicate novel challenge applications, and that review contributions that lower the barrier to applying AI by practitioners outside the AI community. These papers will be reviewed based on different criteria than the longer papers of the main IAAI tracks. Best practice papers must tie the recommendations to concrete learning from prior experience when deploying AI methods. Challenge problem papers *must* make non-generated, real-world data benchmarks publicly available (this is a hard requirement). AI training papers must focus on the particular challenges when bridging knowledge from application domain experts and AI expertise and how the domain experts can effectively and efficiently learn enough about the AI tools they use to apply them successfully. For all topics in the scope of this track, papers that challenge the status quo are particularly welcome.\rPapers in this track may be between four (4) pages and (6) pages long, including references, in the prescribed AAAI style.\rSubmission Instructions\rElectronic submissions are required. Papers must be in trouble-free, high resolution PDF format and formatted for United States letter (8.5\xe2\x80\x9d x 11\xe2\x80\x9d) paper. Submissions need to be in AAAI two-column format (AAAI 2023 Author Kit). Deployed papers can be up to eight (8) pages plus one more page containing only references. Emerging, Tools and Integration papers can be up to six (6) pages plus one more page containing only references. Best practice, Challenge and Training papers may be between four (4) pages and (6) pages long, including references.\rSubmissions to IAAI-23 should contain identifying information of the authors and their affiliations: reviewing is single-blind.\rAuthors should register on the IAAI-23 EasyChair paper submission site. A login and password, as well as detailed instructions about how to submit an electronic paper, will be sent to the author in a subsequent email message. Authors must then submit a formatted electronic version of their paper through EasyChair no later than August 12, 2022. We cannot accept papers submitted by email or fax. Submissions received after the deadline, or that do not meet the length or formatting requirements detailed above, will not be accepted for review. Notification of receipt of the electronic paper will be mailed to the first author (or designated contact author) soon after receipt. By submitting a paper to IAAI, the authors agree that the Program Chairs have the final decision on the acceptance of publication at the conference. Papers will be reviewed by the Program Committee and notification of acceptance or rejection will be mailed to the contact author on October 7, 2022. PDFs of accepted papers will be due on November 18, 2022. Authors will be required to transfer copyright at that time.\rAll submissions must be original. IAAI-23 will not consider any paper that, at the time of submission, is under review for or has already been published or accepted for publication in a journal or another conference. Once submitted to IAAI-23, authors may not submit the paper elsewhere during IAAI\xe2\x80\x99s review period. These restrictions apply only to refereed journals and conferences, not to preliminary versions that are posted as preprints to arXiv.org or other unrefereed forums, or to workshops with a limited audience and without archival proceedings. Authors must confirm that their submissions to IAAI conform to these requirements at the time of submission.\rOrganization\rCorrespondence may be sent to IAAI at iaai23@aaai.org.\r  IAAI-23 chairs:\r\xef\x82\xb7 Karen Haigh (Consultant, USA)\r\xef\x82\xb7 IAAI-23 co-chairs:\ro Alex Wong (University of Waterloo, Canada)\ro YuHao Chen (University of Waterloo, Canada)\r\xef\x82\xb7 IAAI-22 Outreach Chairs:\ro Kai Qin (Swinburne University of Technology, Australia)\ro Jan R.

These issues are of particular importance in the Web and the Internet that enable the interaction of large and diverse populations. The Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE) is an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and results on incentives and computation arising from these various fields. WINE 2022 continues the successful tradition of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (named Workshop on Internet & Network Economics until 2013), which was held annually from 2005 to present.\r The program will feature invited talks, tutorials, paper presentations, a poster session, and a plenary session on spotlights beyond WINE. All paper submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of their contribution, originality, soundness, and significance. Submissions are invited in, but not limited to, the following topics:\r      - Algorithmic Game Theory\r     - Algorithmic Mechanism Design\r     - Market Design \r     - Auction Algorithms and Analysis\r     - Computational Advertising\r     - Computational Aspects of Equilibria\r     - Computational Social Choice\r     - Learning in Markets and Mechanism Design\r     - Learning under Strategic Behavior\r     - Coalitions, Coordination, and Collective Action\r     - Economic Aspects of Security and Privacy\r     - Economic Aspects of Distributed Computing and Cryptocurrencies\r     - Econometrics, ML, and Data Science\r     - Behavioral Economics and Behavioral Modeling\r     - Fairness and Trust in Games and Markets\r     - Price Differentiation and Price Dynamics\r     - Revenue Management\r     - Social Networks and Network Games\r Authors of the accepted papers will have a choice to attend the conference virtually.\r ===============\rImportant Dates\r===============\r Paper submission deadline: July 7, 2022, 11:59pm Pacific Time\r Author notification: before September 7, 2022\r =================\rSubmission Server\r=================\rEasychair submission link:\rhttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wine2022\r =================\rSubmission Format\r=================\r Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts presenting original research on any of the research fields related to WINE 2022.\r An extended abstract submitted to WINE 2022 should start with the title of the paper, each author\xe2\x80\x99s name, affiliation and e-mail address, followed by a one-paragraph summary of the results to be presented. This should then be followed by a technical exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve these results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work.\r The extended abstract should not exceed 18 single-spaced pages (including references) using reasonable margins (at least one-inch margins all around) and at least 11-point font. If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix (with no space limit) that will be read at the discretion of the Program Committee. It is strongly recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and length.\rSubmissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. The above specifications are meant to provide more freedom to the authors at the time of submission. Note that accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages (including references) in the LNCS format in the proceedings (see below).\r The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the ARCoSS/LNCS series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages total in the LNCS format in the proceedings. Submissions are encouraged, though not required, to follow the LNCS format (Latex, Word). More information about the LNCS format can be found on the author instructions page of Springer-Verlag (https://www.springer.com/cn/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).\r Questions regarding the submissions can be directed to the PC chairs via wine2022chairs@gmail.com.\r ===========================\rConflict of Interest Policy\r===========================\r A conflict of interest (COI) is limited to the following categories:\r1.            Family member or close friend.\r2.            Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.\r3.            Person with the same affiliation (department, not institute).\r4.            Involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported).\r5.            Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).\r6.            Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.\r Declaring COIs prevents the specified person from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship (e.g., coauthor, friend, colleague in a different department at the same institution, etc.). Authors can contact the PC chairs directly if they have a conflict with an individual who is likely to be asked to serve as a subreviewer for the paper.\r Even though EasyChair asks the authors to specify the type of conflict of interest when they declare one, the authors do *not* need to answer that question.  They may avoid answering it by choosing the option \xe2\x80\x9cOthers\xe2\x80\x9d.\r ================\rBest Paper Award\r================\r The program committee will decide upon a best paper award and a best student paper award.\r ================\rImportant Notice\r================\r To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.\rThe authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.\r Simultaneous submission of results to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to WINE 2022, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline of WINE 2022, will not be considered. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in WINE 2022. Papers that are accepted and appear as a one-page abstract can be subsequently submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other conference that has a published proceeding.\r ==================\rForward to Journal\r==================\r A forward to journal program is initiated at WINE 2022.

Concretely, the PROOFS workshop seeks contributions in both theory and practice of methods and tools applied to the security of embedded systems. Examples include (semi-)formal methods, simulation-based leakage evaluation and security checks, protocol verification techniques, test and verification of secure embedded systems (software and hardware), and provable security for physical attacks.\r This year, we solicit research papers on topics covering well-motivated computer security problems. Techniques which identify real-world threats, detect them, mitigate them or analyse the consequences will remain the major target of the workshop.\r ===========\rList of Topics\r===========\r Topics of interest include, but are not limited to, the following:\r *    (Automated) security proofs\r*    Applications of formal methods in security\r*    Protocol verification\r*    Security evaluation of real-world systems\r*    Leakage-resilient cryptography\r*    Side-channel analysis and countermeasures\r*    Fault attacks and defenses\r*    Intrusion detection and prevention\r *   Information leakage models\r  *  Tamper-resistant hardware\r   * Countermeasure against hardware Trojan horses\r  *  Early leakage detection, e.g. based on simulators\r*    Vulnerability assessment techniques for side channels\r*    Synergies between security and reliability\r*    On-chip monitoring of physical attacks\r*    Case studies and industrial practice for secure design\r*    Cyber physical systems security and threats against critical infrastructures\r ========\rPublication\r========\rAs in previous years, there will be online open access proceedings of PROOFS.

While we invite any papers that are from associated fields, we ask authors to focus on the Indigenous Studies aspect of their research, interrogating their methodological and theoretical underpinnings, and asking critical questions such as \xe2\x80\x98What is currently over/under-researched in Indigenous Studies today?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98What is the purpose of Indigenous Studies?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98What are best practices when conducting Indigenous Studies research?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98How do we approach Indigenous Studies from a United Kingdom and European standpoint?\xe2\x80\x99\r  Themes and Format\r  We would like to invite panel proposals related to Indigenous Studies which deepen understanding of this area of study, engage critically with it, and draw interdisciplinary linkages or use innovative approaches. Themes include, but are not limited to approaches grounded in the fields of: anthropology, theology, heritage studies and archaeology, law, literature, sociology and history. Broadly, any research engaging with Indigeneity and Indigenous Peoples, knowledge, history, culture, etc. is welcome.  However, we expect submissions to engage with the field itself more widely and focus on interrogating Indigenous Studies as a field, particularly in the UK and Europe. \r  We welcome submissions from both Indigenous and non-Indigenous academics, graduate students, practitioners, community members and activists. Submissions can pertain to any time-period or geographies related to the conference theme. There is no expectation for written papers to be submitted, and we encourage prospective speakers to speak about a work-in-progress.\r  Please submit an abstract of 250 words for your panel proposals with a theme identified and explanation as to its significance within the field. Selected convenors will be invited to assemble a panel of three 15-20 minute oral presentations followed by questions from the audience. \r  We would request you to write to us by 11:59 pm on 27th June at ISDG@CRASSH.cam.ac.uk \r   The ISDG is currently in the process of securing additional funding and may be able to offer limited support to some participants. Kindly let us know with your abstract if you would like to be considered for this. Decisions on selection of presenters are independent of requests for bursaries. \r  If you would like any further information about the conference, please contact us on the same email. \r  About the ISDG\r  The ISDG is a multi-disciplinary award-winning Cambridge-based graduate student-led research network that has been operating in this field since 2019.  It aims to break disciplinary silos, discuss emerging issues in Indigenous Studies and create a platform to make these a part of the everyday intellectual life of academic institutions.

These issues are of particular importance in the Web and the Internet that enable the interaction of large and diverse populations. The Conference on Web and Internet Economics (WINE) is an interdisciplinary forum for the exchange of ideas and results on incentives and computation arising from these various fields. WINE 2022 continues the successful tradition of the Conference on Web and Internet Economics (named Workshop on Internet & Network Economics until 2013), which was held annually from 2005 to present.\r The program will feature invited talks, tutorials, paper presentations, a poster session, and a plenary session on spotlights beyond WINE. All paper submissions will be peer-reviewed and evaluated on the basis of the quality of their contribution, originality, soundness, and significance. Submissions are invited in, but not limited to, the following topics:\r      - Algorithmic Game Theory\r     - Algorithmic Mechanism Design\r     - Market Design \r     - Auction Algorithms and Analysis\r    - Computational Advertising\r     - Computational Aspects of Equilibria\r     - Computational Social Choice\r     - Learning in Markets and Mechanism Design\r     - Learning under Strategic Behavior\r     - Coalitions, Coordination, and Collective Action\r     - Economic Aspects of Security and Privacy\r     - Economic Aspects of Distributed Computing and Cryptocurrencies\r     - Econometrics, ML, and Data Science\r     - Behavioral Economics and Behavioral Modeling\r     - Fairness and Trust in Games and Markets\r     - Price Differentiation and Price Dynamics\r     - Revenue Management\r     - Social Networks and Network Games\r Authors of the accepted papers will have a choice to attend the conference virtually.\r ===============\rImportant Dates\r===============\r Paper submission deadline: July 7, 2022, 11:59pm Pacific Time\r Author notification: before September 7, 2022\r =================\rSubmission Server\r=================\rEasychair submission link:\rhttps://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=wine2022\r =================\rSubmission Format\r=================\r Authors are invited to submit extended abstracts presenting original research on any of the research fields related to WINE 2022.\r An extended abstract submitted to WINE 2022 should start with the title of the paper, each author\xe2\x80\x99s name, affiliation and e-mail address, followed by a one-paragraph summary of the results to be presented. This should then be followed by a technical exposition of the main ideas and techniques used to achieve these results, including motivation and a clear comparison with related work.\r The extended abstract should not exceed 18 single-spaced pages (including references) using reasonable margins (at least one-inch margins all around) and at least 11-point font. If the authors believe that more details are essential to substantiate the claims of the paper, they may include a clearly marked appendix (with no space limit) that will be read at the discretion of the Program Committee. It is strongly recommended that submissions adhere to the specified format and length.\rSubmissions that are clearly too long may be rejected immediately. The above specifications are meant to provide more freedom to the authors at the time of submission. Note that accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages (including references) in the LNCS format in the proceedings (see below).\r The proceedings of the conference will be published by Springer-Verlag in the ARCoSS/LNCS series, and will be available for distribution at the conference. Accepted papers will be allocated 18 pages total in the LNCS format in the proceedings. Submissions are encouraged, though not required, to follow the LNCS format (Latex, Word). More information about the LNCS format can be found on the author instructions page of Springer-Verlag (https://www.springer.com/cn/computer-science/lncs/conference-proceedings-guidelines).\r Questions regarding the submissions can be directed to the PC chairs via wine2022chairs@gmail.com.\r ===========================\rConflict of Interest Policy\r===========================\r A conflict of interest (COI) is limited to the following categories:\r1.            Family member or close friend.\r2.            Ph.D. advisor or advisee (no time limit), or postdoctoral or undergraduate mentor or mentee within the past five years.\r3.            Person with the same affiliation (department, not institute).\r4.            Involved in an alleged incident of harassment (it is not required that the incident be reported).\r5.            Reviewer owes author a favor (e.g., recently requested a reference letter).\r6.            Frequent or recent collaborator whom you believe cannot objectively review your work.\r Declaring COIs prevents the specified person from reviewing a paper, thereby constraining the matching process and so potentially negatively impacting review quality. For this reason, COIs should not be declared automatically based on a prior relationship (e.g., coauthor, friend, colleague in a different department at the same institution, etc.). Authors can contact the PC chairs directly if they have a conflict with an individual who is likely to be asked to serve as a subreviewer for the paper.\r Even though EasyChair asks the authors to specify the type of conflict of interest when they declare one, the authors do *not* need to answer that question.  They may avoid answering it by choosing the option \xe2\x80\x9cOthers\xe2\x80\x9d.\r ================\rBest Paper Award\r================\r The program committee will decide upon a best paper award and a best student paper award.\r ================\rImportant Notice\r================\r To accommodate the publishing traditions of different fields, authors of accepted papers can ask that only a one-page abstract of the paper appear in the proceedings, along with a URL pointing to the full paper.\rThe authors should guarantee the link to be reliable for at least two years. This option is available to accommodate subsequent publication in journals that would not consider results that have been published in preliminary form in conference proceedings. Such papers must be submitted and formatted just like papers submitted for full-text publication.\r Simultaneous submission of results to another conference with published proceedings is not allowed. Results previously published or presented at another archival conference prior to WINE 2022, or published (or accepted for publication) at a journal prior to the submission deadline of WINE 2022, will not be considered. Simultaneous submission of results to a journal is allowed only if the authors intend to publish the paper as a one-page abstract in WINE 2022. Papers that are accepted and appear as a one-page abstract can be subsequently submitted for publication in a journal but may not be submitted to any other conference that has a published proceeding.\r ==================\rForward to Journal\r==================\r A forward to journal program is initiated at WINE 2022.

Data Analytics, Data Mining, Data Science, or more generally the practice of identifying patterns or constructing mathematical models based on data, is at the heart of most new business models or projects.\r Furthermore, the Big Data phenomenon, used to describe challenging scenarios involving either datasets that are too big to be handled using traditional approaches, datasets with diverse formats and semantics, data streams that need to be actioned in real time, or a combination of these, gives rise to significant challenges. These new trends have led to a whole new series of rapidly evolving tools, algorithms and methods which combine data engineering, computer science, statistics and mathematics.\r The aim of this workshop is to present recent results at the intersection of these areas, discussing new methods or algorithms, or applications including Machine Learning, Databases, optimization or any type of algorithms, which consider managing or obtaining value from data.

It will be hosted by UCLouvain on its Brussels campus, with a direct public transport connection to the city center.\r Physical attendance to the conference is strongly encouraged, but the conference will offer a hybrid participation option for participants unable to do otherwise. At least one full registration will be required per accepted paper, regardless of the mode of participation.\r **** Double-blind review ****\r We will use double-blind peer review. All submissions must be anonymous. We will use a somewhat relaxed implementation of double-blind peer review: you are free to disseminate your work through arXiv and other online repositories and give presentations on your work as usual. However, please make sure you do not mention your own name or affiliation in the submission, and please do not include obvious references that reveal your identity. A reviewer who has not previously seen the paper should be able to read it without accidentally learning the identity of the authors. Please feel free to ask the PC chairs if you have any questions about the double-blind policy of OPODIS 2022.\r **** Submissions ****\r - Papers are to be submitted electronically through HotCRP at the following link: https://hotcrp.info.ucl.ac.be/opodis2022/.\r- Submissions must be in English, in pdf format.\r- Submissions must be prepared using the LaTeX style templates for LIPIcs, choosing the A4 paper option.\r- Length: a submission must not exceed 15 pages, including everything but references. Unlimited pages are allowed for references.\r- Cover page: the first page of the submission should be a separate cover page, including only the following information:\r-- The title of the paper,\r-- A list of keywords,\r-- An abstract of 1 to 2 paragraphs summarizing the contributions of the submission,\r-- Whether or not the paper is eligible for the best student paper award.\r- Appendix: the submission may contain a clearly-marked appendix, which will be read at the discretion of the reviewers. If desired, the appendix can be a copy of the full paper.\r The submission must contain a clear presentation of the merits of the paper, including discussion of its importance, prior work, and an outline of key technical ideas and methods used to achieve the main claims. All of the ideas necessary for an expert to fully verify the central claims in the submission, including experimental results, should be included in the submission. \r A submission must report on original research that has not previously appeared in a journal or conference with published proceedings. It should not be concurrently submitted to such a journal or conference. Any overlap with a published or concurrently submitted paper must be clearly indicated. The Program Chairs reserve the right to reject submissions that are out of scope, of clearly inferior quality, or that violate the submission guidelines. Each of the remaining papers will undergo a thorough reviewing process.\r **** Publication ****\r OPODIS has post-proceedings published by Leibniz International Proceedings in Informatics (LIPIcs) in gold open access model.

Particularly, HCA is a method that is used in biological research and drug discovery to identify substances such as small molecules, peptides, or RNAi that alter the phenotype of a cell in a desired manner. Both HCI and HCA feature modules to tackle the specific research including objectives, filters, imaging modes, environmental conditions, etc. Due to the revolution limit, more influential tools are desired for cellular and molecular imaging. On the other hand, the imaging systems are to be supported by modern software tools (including the machine learning tools) with modularity to handle HCIs and HCAs that are characterized by tremendous molecular data.\r The living cell images along with software modules for HCA provide a quantum of cellular assays.

Particularly, HCA is a method that is used in biological research and drug discovery to identify substances such as small molecules, peptides, or RNAi that alter the phenotype of a cell in a desired manner. Both HCI and HCA feature modules to tackle the specific research including objectives, filters, imaging modes, environmental conditions, etc. Due to the revolution limit, more influential tools are desired for cellular and molecular imaging. On the other hand, the imaging systems are to be supported by modern software tools (including the machine learning tools) with modularity to handle HCIs and HCAs that are characterized by tremendous molecular data.\r The living cell images along with software modules for HCA provide a quantum of cellular assays.

The theme of the V-Cybercult 2022 conference is Beyond Biopolitics: Visual Digital Culture and the 21st Century Disruptive Events.\rThe Russian invasion of Ukraine flooded traditional and digital media with static and moving images including newsreels, amateur, and drone footage, or satellite imagery displaying military force abuse, violence against civilians, shelling, damaged and destroyed buildings, and people leaving their homes and country in what was described as the largest exodus since WW2. While social media was banned in Russia and started, in return, to track and control information related to war all over the world, fake news and image manipulation reached maximum levels and seem to be a novelty in re-creating an old-World War discourse within the EU.\rHowever, such imagery of socially and politically disruptive events, following the paths of globalization, was already present in the contemporary visual culture for the last two decades. Attempts to manipulate, control, divert and even capitalize such visual data were an integral part of contemporary crisis management of military conflicts and health emergencies taking place in other parts of the world beyond Europe. The conjunction of bio-, necro-, and psychopolitics, on the one hand, and digitally produced and circulated images associated with socially and politically disruptive events, on the other hand, raises several questions such as: What are the main differences between the reproduction and production of these events in the digital media realm? What is their social impact? How did the digital productions articulate and/or calibrate the political and traditional media discourses? What trends and digital policies can be linked to the control and dissemination of imagery through social networks? What are the main differences between war, pandemic, and other forms of social unrest? How did digitality mediate the COVID-19 pandemic discourse and influence the netizens? How did the latter's activity contribute to the spread of panic and the creation of an infodemic and, eventually, a climate of fear? Soon after, how has digitality changed the way the world perceived the Russian-Ukrainian conflict? How are the EU and US\xe2\x80\x99s geopolitical implications and power relations reflected in the digital mediascape? At the same time, what role do digitally co-produced images such as memes play in the dissemination, circulation, and criticism of information? What types of civic and political resistance were or can still be imagined by artists and netizens alike?\rBeyond Biopolitics: Visual Digital Culture and the 21st Century Disruptive Events encourages engagement with a wide range of topics, which we hope will attract researchers interested in the Y2K problem, 9/11, the Global Financial Crisis, the Boko Haram insurgency, the Mexican drug war, the Syrian Civil War, the Yemeni Crisis, the Tigray War, the COVID-19 pandemic, and the Russo-Ukrainian War in terms of power relations, visual politics, political aesthetics, information politics, biocommunicability,  activist media, network society and the state of emergency, social distancing or memetic warfare. Hence, proposals might address the various social, political, economic, artistic, individual, collective, institutional, representational, and technological dimensions of digital interactions and environments. As mentioned, potential topics include, but are not limited to:\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBio-, necro- and psychopower in the information age.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBiopolitical aesthetics.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tBiocommunicability and the public sphere.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tInformation biopolitics and network society.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tDisruptive events in a global age: digital media and reporting conflict.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tElectronic/platform colonialism.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tNetwork attention.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tDigital citizens and revolutions.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tParticipatory culture and memetic warfare.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tNetnography and cyberethics.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tPost-literate society.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tTechnocriticism.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tTechnorealism.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tPlatform capitalism and social media ideologies.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tCancel culture.\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tPost-truth politics.\r Keynote speakers:\rMark DEUZE \xe2\x80\x93 Professor of Journalism and Media Culture at the University of Amsterdam.\rJan VAN DIJK \xe2\x80\x93 Professor of Communication Science and the Sociology of the Information Society at the University of Twente.\rPayal Arora - Professor of Technology, Values, and Global Media Cultures at Erasmus University Rotterdam.\rRyan M.

For example,\rthe internet has permitted an increase in collaborative artistic practice,\ropportunities to share works of art with fans and friends, and has\rsometimes offset the financial burden of having to operate in a marketplace\rwhere it is \xe2\x80\x98unknown\xe2\x80\x99 how creativity will be received before its consumption.\rSome technological interventions have produced backlash and questions\rabout authentic creative practice. Musical artists, for instance, are criticized\rfor the ongoing use of autotune. Today, the gamut of this intersection of\rart and technology runs from the commercial side that has made \xe2\x80\x98real\xe2\x80\x99\rthe virtual actor across to the art side where the digital projection of\ranimated experiences of Van Gogh\xe2\x80\x99s greatest works populates the walls\rof entertainment facilities. Within this spectrum, technological influences,\raugmentations and directions are revolutionizing the production and\rconsumption of art, while others have undermined the symbolic nature of\rthese creative products.\rIn the twenty-first century, we are increasingly seeing the insertion of\rmachine creativity alongside or even on top of the human artist with greater\rattention needed on the role of the technical artefact in the entire creative\rprocess. Artistic expression has long been considered the purview of the\rpeople, when, in fact, more attention could be levelled at the influence of\rtechnology on creative products and experiences. What is clear is that\rartists and creatives continue to explore the capacity of technology to evolve\rtheir craft to make it more accessible, challenge genres and conventions, for\rboth commercial, educational, and intrinsic motivations.\rFor this Special Issue, we are interested in how changes in technology\rare directly impacting artists, creatives, producers and/or the consumer,\raficionado or fans to start conversations around issues such as \xe2\x80\x98where to\rnext?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98what constitutes art?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98has art lost its \xe2\x80\x9cmeaning\xe2\x80\x9d?\xe2\x80\x99, \xe2\x80\x98who is the real\rcreator/author?\xe2\x80\x99 or \xe2\x80\x98has creativity developed new meanings altogether?\xe2\x80\x99 The\rSpecial Issue will explore, then, whether the practices of art and creativity\rhinge on new forms of technological determinism and how technology is\rimpacting creative outputs and experiences from the movie set to the fine\rart gallery.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149593"">MDPI-SI on DT &amp; FIE in Ed--Scopus,JCI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMDPI Education Sciences Journal - Special Issue on Digital Twins and Future Intelligent Educational Environments\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166565"">IUI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIntelligent User Interfaces\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150592"">EvoCompAISecurity&amp;Privacy 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEvolutionary Computing for AI-Driven Security and Privacy: Advancing the state-of-the-art applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164435"">CoCo4MT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2nd CFP - The First Workshop on Corpus Generation and Corpus Augmentation for Machine Translation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150007"">WSCIS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 3rd International Workshop on Smart City and Intelligent Systems (WSCIS 2022) \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167079"">ICAART 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n15th International Conference on Agents and Artificial Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164468"">AI-DH 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMDPI Big Data and Cognitive Computing - Special Issue on Artificial Intelligence in Digital Humanities\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153616"">Xiamen SSRA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Smart Systems Research and Applications (SSRA 2022) \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150008"">ABDAI-Sanya 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 4th International Conference on Applications of Big Data and Artificial Intelligence(ABDAI 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163786"">DALI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDALI: The 2nd MICCAI Workshop on Data Augmentation, Labeling, and Imperfections\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

CNS disorders, particularly neurodegenerative disorders, are a serious public health concern that necessitates a considerable amount of attention from researchers to protect people from them. These diseases are caused by a wide range of problems with the way neurons communicate with each other. They include neurodegenerative and metabolic diseases that are controlled by neural connections.\rVarious treatment procedures have been implemented over the last few decades, but their therapeutic success has been insufficient, resulting in only partial symptom relief. The blood-cerebrospinal fluid barrier (BSCFB), and the blood-brain barrier (BBB) protect the CNS from harmful substances and pose significant challenges in delivering drugs into the CNS for the treatment of CNS complications such as Parkinson's disease, brain tumors, Alzheimer's disease, multiple sclerosis, Huntington's disease, encephalitis, and so on. Nanomedicines can efficiently deliver therapeutics to the brain, implying favorable outcomes in the treatment of neuron-related illnesses. \rMolecules can be nanoengineered to perform a variety of functions, including crossing the BBB, targeting specific cells or signaling pathways, responding to endogenous stimuli, acting as a vehicle for gene delivery, and supporting nerve regeneration and cell survival. The role of nanocarrier systems such as Nanodiamonds, liposomes, micelles, solid lipid nanoparticles (SLNPs), dendrimers, and nanoemulsions in the delivery of various neurotherapeutic agents has been discussed in this book, as well as their mechanism of action and nanoformulation of different neuroprotective agents and nerve growth factors. \rThis book will shed light on nanomedicines' great potential for effectively delivering treatments to the brain, revealing promising outcomes in the treatment of neuron-related disorders. This book will also recognize the tremendous distance between the bench and the bedside, as well as the limits of present tactics.\r Editors:\r Dr. Rishabha Malviya\rGalgotias University, India\r  Dr. Kamla Pathak\rUttar Pradesh University of Medical Sciences, Saifai, Etawah, India.\r Swati Verma\rGalgotias University, India\r  Table of content (but not limited to):\r 1.\tIntroduction to Nano formulation\r2.\tA synopsis of Neurodegenerative disorders\r3.\tUse of Nano formulations in the treatment of Neurodegenerative disorders\r4.\tImplication of Herbal Nano formulation in the treatment of Neurological disorders\r5.\tClinical strategies, Management and Challenges in targeting Neuro disorders\r6.\tApplication of Medicinal plants and their Phytoconstituents\r7.\tAdvantages of Nano formulation in the treatment of NDs\r8.\tCurrent trends in drug Nano formulations directed to brain\r9.\tObstacles to BBB-targeted drug delivery\r10.\tOverview of BBB transport mechanisms \r11.\tThe Real issue in targeting neurodegenerative disease\r12.\tOverview of techniques employed for the preparation of Nano formulation\r13.\tNano approaches towards CNS Drug delivery\r14.\tNeuronal targeting with nano-based approaches\r15.\tOverview of BBB Bypass Strategies \r16.\tApplication of Nanodiamonds in the treatment of neuro disorders\r Book will be published in Apple Academic Press, Taylor and Francis.\r Contact Details:\r editor.rishabha@gmail.com\r+91-9450352185\r \n""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137822"">MIAM 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMiami Winter Symposium 2023 - Molecular Neuroscience: Focus on Sensory Disorders\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162557"">ICOICC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Conference on Innovative Strategies in Intelligent Computing and Communication (ICOICC - 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157903"">IJBISS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal of Business Information Systems Strategies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167663"">ICON-BITS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Conference on Best Innovative Teaching Strategies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161100"">SF 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall For Springer BOOK Chapters: Green Finance Instruments, Fintech, and Investment Strategies: An Analysis of Sustainable Portfolio Management in the Post-COVID 19 Era\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155065"">WBC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n19th International Conference on Web Based Communities and Social Media\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162889"">FutureUDNs 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nWorkshop on Sustainable Future Ultra Dense Networks - To be held in Globecom 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153311"">ICWPT--EI Compendex, Scopus 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 7th International Conference on Water Pollution and Treatment (ICWPT 2022)--Ei Compendex, Scopus\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156269"">AIBSAT  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpecial Session on Artificial Intelligence for Biomedical Sensing, Analysis and Treatment\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=143505"">IT3/HWC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n39th International Conference on Thermal Treatment Technologies &amp; Hazardous Waste Combustors\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

As we are deep into the Information Age, huge amounts of data are generated every day from sensors, individual archives, social networks, Internet of Things, enterprises and Internet in various scales and format which will pose a major challenge to the dependability of our designed systems. As these systems oftentend to become inert, fragile, and vulnerable after a period of running. Effectively improving the dependability of sensor, cloud, big data systems and applications has become increasingly critical.\r This conference provides a forum for individuals, academics, practitioners, and organizations who are developing or procuring sophisticated computer systems on whose dependability of services they need to place great confidence. Future systems need to close the dependability gap in face of challenges in different circumstances. The emphasis will be on differing properties of such services, e.g., continuity, effective performance, real-time responsiveness, corruption, anomaly, ability to avoid catastrophic failures, prevention of deliberate privacy intrusions, reliability, availability, sustainability, adaptability, heterogeneity, security, safety, and so on.\r Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\rTrack 1: Dependability and Security Fundamentals and Technologies\r-Concepts, theory, and methodologies\r-Dependability of sensor, networks\r-Dependability issues in cloud/fog/edge\r-Security and privacy\r-Security/privacy in cloud/fog/edge\r-Artificial intelligence\r-Big data foundation and management\r-Dependable IoT supporting technologies\rTrack 2 : Dependable and Secure Systems\r-Dependable sensor systems\r-Dependability issues in distributed systems\r-Cyber-physical systems\r-Database and transaction processing systems\r-Safety and security in distributed systems\r-Dependability in automotive systems\r-Dependability in big data systems\r-Software system security\r-Blockchain-based systems\rTrack 3: Dependable and Secure Applications\r-Sensor and robot applications\r-Big data applications\r-Cloud/fog/edge applications\r-Safety care, medical care and services\r-Aerospace, transportation applications\r-Energy, smart city, smart grid\r-IoT, CPS and industrial application\rTrack 4 : Dependability and Security Measures and Assessments\r-Metrics and measures for safety, trust, faith\r-Levels and assessment criteria and authority\r-Dependability measurement, modeling\r-Dependability evaluation\r-Software reliability and verification\r-Hardware reliability and verification\r-Evaluations and tools\r Paper Submission Guidelines\rThe materials presented in the papers should not be published or under submission elsewhere.

Consistent with our long-term goals for inclusivity and sustainability, all activities will be 100% online, including keynote speaker(s), research presentations, and opportunities for virtual networking. Visit the DBA website to learn more about this new organization: dress-body-association.org.\r The Beginner\xe2\x80\x99s Mind: Asking and Telling About Dress Studies\r Dress studies is an interdisciplinary field that intersects with many others, including (but definitely not limited to) area studies, gender and sexuality, sociology, art history, media studies, theater, philosophy, design, fashion studies, and anthropology. We welcome presentations about any aspect of dress and/or the body that are drawn from ongoing research, teaching, artistic, and/or activist ventures, however this year we are asking presenters to use a little of their time to reflect on their engagement with dress studies.\r If you\xe2\x80\x99re new to this field\xe2\x80\xa6\r What questions do you have?\r How did you first encounter dress studies?\r How is dress and/or the body viewed within your discipline?\r What/how can your discipline contribute to scholarship on dress and/or the body?\r If you\xe2\x80\x99re not new to dress studies\xe2\x80\xa6\r How did you first get involved?\r Is there anything you wish you had known earlier?\r What have been some of the key texts/theories/methods for you?  How have they guided/influenced your work?\r Where would you locate the untapped potentials/opportunities of dress studies as an inherently interdisciplinary field of study?\r Submissions will be accepted from any discipline as long as the topic relates to this broad theme. Both beginning and advanced scholars are welcome. Abstracts should be 200-300 words. Presenters do not need to submit a paper before the conference, but should plan to speak for up to 30 minutes with time for discussion at the end of each panel.\r Although we welcome scholars from any country, the language of the conference will be English. We will consider a panel in another language if there is sufficient interest from a group of scholars. Abstracts must be written in English and should be drawn from original research; we ask that presenters not simply recycle lectures from other conferences. The DBA welcomes creative approaches and non-traditional presentations.\r For best consideration, please submit your abstract by August 1, 2022. All submissions will be read by at least two reviewers in a single-blind review process. Authors can expect to receive notification of acceptance within 2 to 3 weeks after the deadline.  \r Registration through the DBA website will be required for access to the online platform.  Donations are welcome, but not required to participate. The recommended donation is 20 USD for students and early-career scholars, 50 USD for mid-career and senior scholars. \r To submit an abstract: dress-body-association.org/abstracts\r To register for the conference: dress-body-association.org/conference-registration\r Mission Statement of the Dress and Body Association\r\xe2\x80\x9cDress\xe2\x80\x9d is a highly inclusive concept that includes all varieties of body supplements and body modifications* found in human cultures around the world. It is not limited to clothing, costume, or fashion or to any particular time, place, or economic structure. The mission of the Dress and Body Association (DBA) is to bring together scholars from diverse disciplines and areas of the world to share academic research about dress and body practices understood broadly, to offer quality opportunities for networking, and to forge links with like-minded individuals and organizations.\r The Dress and Body Association is based entirely online, an essential structure for\r1) Flexibility: In-person conferences are cumbersome and expensive to plan, which makes them difficult to change or adapt to new circumstances.\r2) Accessibility: Travel is expensive and time-consuming. Many scholars cannot afford to travel.  Even scholars with funding may have restrictions due to caretaking responsibilities, health issues, difficulty obtaining a visa, etc.  \r3) Inclusivity: \xe2\x80\x98Dress and the body\xe2\x80\x99 is a subject that pertains to all human cultures, the DBA is committed to including scholars from diverse disciplines and areas of the world.\r4) Sustainability: International travel is not only expensive, but harmful to the planet. Online activities reduce consumption and waste.\r *Joanne B.

His writing and directorial credits have coalesced around Western spaces, lifeworlds, and characters, ranging from his breakthrough script for Sicario (2015) to the television phenomenon that is Yellowstone (2018\xe2\x80\x93), which has become a beachhead for an evolving ecology of television content (1883 [2021\xe2\x80\x93], 1932 [forthcoming], 6666 [forthcoming], etc.). Seeking to highlight the fastest-growing geo-cultural region in the United States, Taylor Sheridan advances expansive views of the West that are deliberately complex, difficult, and challenging. In short, his creative output posits that the West, with its interweavings of history and mythography, matters.\r Consequently, the proposed book project seeks to assemble a collection of original contributions (6,000-8,000 words) which map and assess Taylor Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s Wests. We welcome equally proposals for works that pursue thematic through-lines cutting across Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s growing catalogue and for in-depth readings of individual movie and/or television titles. We invite proposals from scholars at all stages of their careers. Possible topic areas and/or themes include but are by no means limited to:\r * Shedding light on the effects of the Necrocene/Capitalocene in the West\r* (Mis)representing Native American lifeworlds and sovereignty (e.g. Land Back discourses, the pathology of settler colonialism, etc.)\r* Excavating \xe2\x80\x9cflyover country\xe2\x80\x9d from mainstream neglect\r* Spatial liminalities: border crossings, border spaces, liminal characters\r* Post-West(ern) poetics, revisionist discourses, the appeal and pitfalls of western nostalgia\r* Tall tales, western humor, cowboy antics\r* Neo-pastoralism\r* Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s Wests as New-New American Gothic?\r* Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s \xe2\x80\x9cauthenticity work\xe2\x80\x9d (e.g. livestock raising, husbandry, and horsemanship economies, sartorial aesthetics and accoutrements of Western life, firearms, extraction and surveillance technologies, etc.)\r* Ecocritical readings of Sheridan\xe2\x80\x99s work (e.g. land ownership versus stewardship, human-non-human interfaces, etc.)\r* Masculinities, aging, toxic, redemptive, and otherwise\r* Ethics of law and/or justice\r* Violence and exploitation: abject spaces, bodies, and acts\r* Transmedia (f)ranchising and fandom: intersections between texts, paratexts (e.g. podcasts, aftershows, etc.), and invested audiences (e.g. Yellowstone fanfiction, social media, etc.)\r* Sonic Wests: soundscapes, soundtracks, etc.\r If you are interested in proposing a chapter, please email an abstract of 500\xe2\x80\x93700 words to taylorsheridanswests@gmail.com.

These data represent an extremely rich heritage that can be exploited in a wide variety of fields, from Social Sciences and Humanities to land use and territorial policies, including smart city, urban planning, smart tourism and culture, creative media and entertainment. In terms of research in computer science, they address challenging problems related to the diversity and volume of the media across time, the variety of content descriptors (potentially including the time dimension), the veracity of the data, and the different user needs with respect to engaging with this rich material and the extraction of value out of the data. These challenges are reflected in various research topics such as multimodal and mixed media search, automatic content analysis, multimedia linking and recommendation, and big data analysis and visualization, where scientific bottlenecks may be exacerbated by the time dimension, which also provides topics of interest such as multimodal time series analysis.\r The objective of this edition is to present and discuss the latest and most significant trends in the analysis, structuring and understanding of multimedia contents dedicated to the valorization of heritage, with the emphasis on enabling access to the big data of the past. We welcome research contributions for the following (but not limited to) topics:\r Multimedia and cross-domain data interlinking and recommendation\rDating and spatialization of historical data\rMixed media data access and indexing\rDeep learning in adverse conditions (transfer learning, learning with side information, etc.)\rMulti-modal time series analysis, evolution modelling\rMulti-modal and multi-temporal data rendering\rHeritage \xe2\x80\x93 Building Information Modelling, Art Virtualisation\rHCI / Interfaces for large-scale datasets\rSmart digitisation of massive quantities of data\rBench-marking, Open Data Movement\rGenerative modelling of cultural heritage\r IMPORTANT DATES\rPaper submission: 8 July 2022 (11:59 p.m. AoE)\rAuthor acceptance notification: 26 July 2022\rCamera-Ready: 7 August 2022\rWorkshop date: 10 October 2022\r SUBMISSION GUIDELINES\rAll submissions must be original work not under review at any other workshop, conference or journal.

Exascale workflows are projected to include multiple different components from both scale-up and scale-out communities operating together to drive scientific discovery and innovation. With the often conflicting design choices between optimizing for write-intensive vs. read-intensive, having flexible I/O systems will be crucial to support these hybrid workloads. Another performance aspect is the intensifying complexity of parallel file and storage systems in large-scale cluster environments. Storage system designs are advancing beyond the traditional two-tiered file system and archive model by introducing new tiers of temporary, fast storage close to the computing resources with distinctly different performance characteristics. \r The changing landscape of emerging hybrid HPC workloads along with the ever increasing gap between the compute and storage performance capabilities reinforces the need for an in-depth understanding of extreme-scale I/O and for rethinking existing data storage and management techniques. Traditional approaches of managing data might fail to address the challenges of extreme-scale hybrid workloads. Novel I/O optimization and management techniques integrating machine learning and AI algorithms, such as intelligent load balancing and I/O pattern prediction, are needed to ease the handling of the exponential growth of data as well as the complex hierarchies in the storage and file systems. Furthermore, user-friendly, transparent and innovative approaches are essential to adapt to the needs of different HPC I/O workloads while easing the scientific and commercial code development and efficiently utilizing extreme-scale parallel I/O and storage resources.\r Established at IEEE Cluster 2021, the Re-envisioning Extreme-Scale I/O for Emerging Hybrid HPC Workloads (REX-IO) workshop has created a forum for experts, researchers, and engineers in the parallel I/O and storage, compute facility operation, and HPC application domains. REX-IO solicits novel work that characterizes I/O behavior and identifies the challenges in scientific data and storage management for emerging HPC workloads, introduces potential solutions to alleviate some of these challenges, and demonstrates the effectiveness of the proposed solutions to improve I/O performance for the exascale supercomputing era and beyond. We envision that this workshop will contribute to the community and further drive discussions between storage and I/O researchers, HPC application users and the data analytics community to give a better in-depth understanding of the impact on the storage and file systems induced by emerging HPC applications.\r Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r- Understanding I/O inefficiencies in emerging workloads such as complex multi-step workflows, in-situ analysis, AI, and data analytics methods  \r- New I/O optimization techniques, including how ML and AI algorithms might be adapted for intelligent load balancing and I/O pattern prediction of complex, hybrid application workloads\r- Performance benchmarking, resource management, and I/O behavior studies of emerging workloads\r- New possibilities for the I/O optimization of emerging application workloads and their I/O subsystems\r- Efficient tools for the monitoring of metadata and storage hardware statistics at runtime, dynamic storage resource management, and I/O load balancing\r- Parallel file systems, metadata management, and complex data management\r- Understanding and efficiently utilizing complex storage hierarchies beyond the traditional two-tiered file system and archive model\r- User-friendly tools and techniques for managing data movement among compute and storage nodes\r- Use of staging areas, such as burst buffers or other private or shared acceleration tiers for managing intermediate data between computation tasks\r- Application of emerging big data frameworks towards scientific computing and analysis\r- Alternative data storage models, including object and key-value stores, and scalable software architectures for data storage and archive\r- Data movement for HPC on edge devices\r- Position papers on related topics\r ================================\rSubmission Guidelines\r================================\rAll papers must be original and not simultaneously submitted to another journal or conference.

As a subfield, digital twins for cities is a promising topic with unexplored potential. Both topics are influenced by different spheres of AI: acquisition and evaluation of big data, semantic technologies, agent-based modeling/distributed simulation, but also the human-computer interaction challenges that arise from the work with digital twins. As such, both topics are deeply nested in the context of the KI2022 conference. In this workshop, we aim to examine the different angles, challenges and technologies from which the smart city concept can benefit from AI and digital twins. We call for extended abstracts on past works and experience, demonstrations of implemented systems and presentations of novel research questions and ideas to promote a joint discussion on how the use of digital twins for smart cities can be advanced by means of AI to address future challenges.\r Topics include but are not limited to:\r  - What constitutes a digital twin for a smart city, and how can this information be represented adequately in order to allow the application of AI while at the same time protecting the rights and interests of citizens and society?\r  - Is a digital twin in a smart city just a simulation or a semantic data space?\r  - What are online and offline properties of smart city applications?\r  - What are successful implementations of digital twins for smart cities, esp. with a focus on AI?\r  - How can aspects of transparency and explainability be supported?\r  - Which organizational structures are required to design, build, and use a digital twin for smart cities?\r  - How do citizens interact with smart city applications? What is required to ensure their broad acceptance?\r Submission:\r  - Extended abstracts may consist of up to 3 pages (excl. references) \r  - Presentation of extended abstracts and panel discussions\r  - Joint publication of postproceedings in thematic groups\r Format and schedule:\rThe workshop is planned to be a physical event. All accepted submissions will be grouped into related topic blocks, during which each participant presents their contribution in a 10 minute presentation. Each block is concluded by a panel talk, summarizing common findings, experiences and problems encountered in this topic block.\r Organizers:\r  Falco Nogatz, Veronika Kurchyna, Ingo J.

On top of these deficiencies, approximately 40% of all produced food is wasted throughout the farm to fork continuum, while more than 900 million people remain undernourished.\r It is evident that the margin for optimizing the global food system is huge and may unlock pathways towards the stability of the Earth system and the future of humanity.\r Recognizing these grand food waste challenges, the RETASTE Conference initiates the dialogue for innovative solutions and optimization schemes that take advantage of the significant opportunities for food waste reduction, reuse, and recycling at all levels of the food life cycle, as well as their scalability and commercial translatability. At the same time, RETASTE strives to address social aspects and highlight ways to overcome social and perception barriers against reducing our environmental footprint, thus shifting the evolving future of social, market, and global megatrends.\r Through the effective conservation of natural resources, the strengthening of the social fabric, and the creation of new value chains, RETASTE strives to advance the applicability of Circular Economy concepts.\r Our audience includes academia, industry, and stakeholders, and is truly transdisciplinary as the subject dictates.

The definition of a refugee, as enshrined in the 1951 Refugee Convention, is someone who \xe2\x80\x98is unable or unwilling to return to their country of origin owing to a well-founded fear of being persecuted for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion.\xe2\x80\x99 But this definition has been regularly challenged over the past 60 years and is under constant review by academics, governments, and humanitarian agencies. Many forcibly displaced people around the world do not easily fit within this formal category.\r The conference takes a critical approach to question normative understandings and addressing empirical puzzles regarding how refugees and international refugee advocacy networks mobilize international and national law and policies to offer new understandings of refugee protection and vulnerabilities. All research seeking to deepen understandings regarding how national institutions define, mediate and respond to refugee legal concerns in crisis will be taken into consideration. In addition to the contemporary refugee crises, historical case studies will be an important part of the event.\r Scholars from different fields such as political science, history, sociology, anthropology, gender studies, urban studies, architecture, literature, poetry, art history, life sciences, and other fields are welcome to propose their interdisciplinary work at the conference. \n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164515"">ICRRR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2nd International Conference on Refugee, Resistance, and Recognition: Global Literary Representations in [Post]post-colonial Perspectives\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149900"">Call for Papers 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Papers Historical Yearbook 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166522"">Hegemillions 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nHegemons, warlords, and refugees\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163868"">HBPSC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n7th\xc2\xa0HBP Student Conference\xc2\xa0on Interdisciplinary Brain Research\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163165"">ICHC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 The 9th International Conference on History and Culture (ICHC 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166252"">EICC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEuropean Interdisciplinary Cybersecurity Conference (EICC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163167"">ICOSH 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 The 11th International Conference on Sociality and Humanities (ICOSH 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159498"">ICSP 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Spirituality and Psychology\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=95801"">ICAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n10th International Conference on Asian Studies 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167208"">doctrineofdiscovery 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Authors on the Doctrine of Discovery\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Also, the term \xe2\x80\x9cmemory,\xe2\x80\x9d at the individual level or at the social, or collective level has different connotations due to the interdisciplinary conceptualization of the memory itself. Memory can be seen in psychology, as relating to an individual, his / her ways to remember or forget, and amnesia. Else, memory can be regarded in the collective form and as a collectively shared representation of the past, or it can come up with political terms like national memory, public memory, vernacular memory, or counter-memory.\r \xe2\x80\x8bAdditionally, collective memories can also be regarded as a \xe2\x80\x9cfloating gap\xe2\x80\x9d between memory and history. Therefore, remembering and amnesia play a significant role in defining the positioning of the memory. The \xe2\x80\x9ccultural memory,\xe2\x80\x9d comprises that body of reusable texts, images, and rituals specific to each society in each different time era which can be in the form of the texts, rites, images, monuments, and buildings that are designed to recall fateful events in the history of the collective. They are sanctioned as a common heritage of a society that is accumulated in the Longue Duree. As coined with individual and cultural memory \xe2\x80\x9cthe idea of individual memory,\xe2\x80\x9d as Maurice Halbwachs states, \xe2\x80\x9cabsolutely separate from social memory, is an abstraction almost devoid of the meaning.\xe2\x80\x9d How a nation remembers also defines a branch in memory studies because \xe2\x80\x9cnations can repress with psychological impunity; their collective memories can be changed without a \xe2\x80\x98return of the suppress\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d. Other than individual amnesia, we can speak about a social forgetting which links social, political, and cultural factors at work.\r The interdisciplinary character of the memory links itself to various areas from psychology, sociology, history, identity studies, literary studies, urban history, space history, and media studies to discourse analysis, and other relevant fields linking the subject with the use of memory.\r In 2019, The DAKAM Memory Studies Conference, in its fourth year, aims to provide a platform for discussions and research, which considers various aspects of literature as a memorial medium to contribute to the larger discussion of the ways in which societies and individuals recollect their past and as a field of observation of personal memory to explore and experience the complexities of the mind and emotions.\r Scholars from different fields such as political science, history, sociology, anthropology, gender studies, urban studies, architecture, literature, poetry, art history, life sciences, and other fields are welcome to propose their interdisciplinary work at the conference. \r \xe2\x80\x8b\rwritten by \xc3\x96zge Mumcu\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=109944"">MEMORY 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n MEMORY, TRAUMA AND RECOVERY - International Interdisciplinary Conference\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149900"">Call for Papers 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Papers Historical Yearbook 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=95801"">ICAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n10th International Conference on Asian Studies 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=115439"">NOSTALGIA - 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n MEMORY, MELANCHOLY AND NOSTALGIA  - 7th International Interdisciplinary Conference \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165112"">HSIC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n1st International Humanities \xe2\x80\x93 Society \xe2\x80\x93 Identity Congress\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167802"">Critical Plant Studies Book Series 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCritical Plant Studies Book Series\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=159351"">MIGRATION 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMIGRATION, ADAPTATION AND MEMORY - 5th International Interdisciplinary Conference (Online)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163165"">ICHC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 The 9th International Conference on History and Culture (ICHC 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164999"">MS - 22/2 (2022) 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCfP: International Studies journal (Winter 2022, including special thematic interest: International Relations after 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=83834"">POST 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPOSTCOLONIALISM, POSTCOMMUNISM AND POSTMODERNISM International Interdisciplinary Conference \n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

What role do ensuing power differences between these factors play in our globalized and mediatized world? What measures have been taken, in the past and the present, in order to prevent discrimination and exclusion? And how do academic, cultural, artistic, journalistic, and policy-making institutions respond to these societal challenges?\r Emancipation, the recognition of differences, and awareness of intersections of gender with other factors of identity-making (class, race, age, sexuality, etc.) are crucial tools in analyzing social and cultural relations in today\xe2\x80\x99s postcolonial and post-secular societies.\r The conference explores the ways that femininity and masculinity affect an individual\xe2\x80\x99s thought process. This is relevant in a variety of realms, such as social organizations and institutions, interpersonal relationships, and understandings of identity and sexuality.\r Power will also be explored as it relates to gender and other forms of identity, including sexuality, race, class, religion, and nationality as encompasses interdisciplinary fields, which include exploration of the histories and experiences of diverse women and men as well as studies of sexualities, masculinities, femininities, and gender systems in society. The conference will also welcome studies that analyze how gender plays out in politics, intimate life, culture, the workplace, athletics, technology, health, science, and the very production of knowledge itself.\r The relationship between gender and society historically and cross-culturally, the changes now occurring in the roles of women and men, the participation of women in the major institutions of society, and women themselves are among the topics to be included.

Focusing on a multidimensional urban phenomenon, this international conference aims to deepen the understanding of informality by opening it to discussion with contributions from various disciplines like architecture, urban planning, sociology, history, economy, and anthropology.\r The emergence of informality as a concept in scholarly discussions can be traced back to the 1970s when \xe2\x80\x9cthe informal sector\xe2\x80\x9d was first used by ILO reports on employment and poverty. The results of the global economic restructuring -such as the flexibilization of production and employment relations, deterioration of collective responsibility, and welfare functions of the state- damage the security of the urban poor in terms of housing and working. Meanwhile, recent socio-economic public policies seem to intensify the condition of informality. Now, it is widely accepted that an informal way of living is a necessity for the urban poor as a survival strategy. Hence, informal work and housing constitute a significant proportion of urban economies and policies.\r What is new in the neo-liberal age is the extending scope of informality. Today, the boundary between the formal and informal is blurred more than before since most urbanites, including the middle classes, experience both formal and informal encounters in their everyday life. Besides, even the urban rich contribute to informality through the development projects on the invaded peripheral land. Consequently, contemporary informality affects not just a marginal segment of the society but a majority of people living in urban spaces.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162684"">S.ARCH Berlin 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nS.ARCH BERLIN  The 10th International Conference on Architecture and Built Environment 04-06 April 2023\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154586"">ICBSTS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 3rd International Conference on Building Science, Technology and Sustainability (ICBSTS 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=148283"">SWP / ACA -  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nPanel Proposal: Iconography and Iconoclasm in 20th Century and Contemporary Poetry\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154584"">Springer--ICAMC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpringer--2022 8th International Conference on Architecture, Materials and Construction (ICAMC 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165714"">2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nVolume 48 - Urban Analytics: Capabilities and Critiques\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=148149"">GridCom 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n14th International Conference on Grid Computing \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156312"">IJBBR  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal of BRIC Business Research\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161318"">Smart Cities 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSmart Cities: Urban Profiling with Artificial Intelligence and Big Data\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164837"">DARCH NOVEMBER 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on Architecture and Design\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166516"">URS  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nUrban Regeneration and Sustainability (URS) - 3rd Edition\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

The history of the senses became prominent within historical study during the 1990s and was methodologically based upon earlier inspirational work that combined anthropological questions of cultural learning with the radical tones of social history. As it has expanded, the field has provided \xe2\x80\x93 and continues to provide \xe2\x80\x93 a considerable space for the exploration of diverse historical topics through the lens of sensory experience and phenomenological interpretation. The central focus of this edited volume is a global history of the senses. As such, this CFP desires a wide range of authors working in Sensory History and Sensory Studies.\r We are specifically looking for authors interested in writing two types of pieces.\r The first group will complete larger historiographical essays of 10,000 words focused on sight, touch, smell, sound, taste, and other sensory worlds. Authors interested in writing one of these six chapters should be able to create a succinct reading of a wide range of interdisciplinary material focused on understanding considerably long historical trajectories of the senses.\r The second group of authors will complete shorter essays that offer brief historiographical entries and an opportunity to promote their own research. Each of these smaller, 6,000 word, essays includes a topic of the author\xe2\x80\x99s choosing after consultation with the editors, and a brief historiographical background for that topic.\r Examples include focused subjects underneath the guiding sections of: Gender, Sexuality, and the Senses; Religion, Faith, Spiritualism; Race, Racism, Ethnicity, and the Senses; Class, Social Spaces, and the Senses; Governance, Law, Power, and the Senses; Remembrance, Reclamation, Re-enactment and Reconstruction; Science, Medicine, and the Senses; Media, Technology, and the Senses; Emotions and the Senses; Military and Diplomacy. As a global history we are seeking authors from a wide range of regions who can provide historical case studies that also illustrate historiographies of Sensory Studies.\r If you are interested in contributing to this volume, please e-mail smellhistory@gmail.com. The deadline for initial e-mails of interest, including a CV and a short statement concerning the type of article and the specific sensory history you are interested in working with, is July 1 of 2022. Please place a subject heading of \xe2\x80\x9cRoutledge History of the Senses\xe2\x80\x9d for that e-mail. After confirmation of topics and e-mail consultation on the focus of the essays, initial drafts will be due January 1 of 2023.\r Contact Info: \rsmellhistory@gmail.com\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155149"">IJHAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal of Humanities, Art and Social Studies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149900"">Call for Papers 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Papers Historical Yearbook 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=164122"">icnmc 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n10th International Conference on New Music Concepts\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=143187"">HEC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Inaugural Honolulu Education Conference\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167744"">Handbook of Trans Literature 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163165"">ICHC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 The 9th International Conference on History and Culture (ICHC 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=147771""> DRIJ 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nDental Research: An International Journal\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167745"">Handbook of Trans Literature 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156692"">EJHSS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEuropean Journal of Humanities and Social Sciences 5-2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166514"">Handbook of Trans Literature 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Routledge Handbook of Trans Literature\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"
