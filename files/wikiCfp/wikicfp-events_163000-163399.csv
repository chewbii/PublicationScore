In this second edition, we want to deepen our previous reflection and consider new topics. For example, is it still possible today to speak of cultures that are somehow homogeneous and spatially circumscribed? Or, instead, is it more appropriate to overturn these assumptions and overall deconstruct the concepts of culture and space? How is it possible to study various cultural dynamics in a world where Identity and Otherness are not only organized in terms of generalized proximity or distance, but also according to overlapping global and local forms? To this respect, what is the position of social scientists regarding individual, subjective and processual experiences? To what extent do \xe2\x80\x9csubjective\xe2\x80\x9d or \xe2\x80\x9cobjective\xe2\x80\x9d approaches contribute to the result of the research and to the formalization of the process? A further, delicate question should also be included in our consideration: the recent pandemics have revealed new asymmetries between minorities and larger groups, the vulnerable and the powerful of the world. How can we deal with these new asymmetries and, more specifically, how can we position ourselves as scholars? Finally, larger access to the digital world is increasingly changing the relationships established between fiction and reality, the everyday and the extraordinary, spaces and otherness. How are these subjects articulated alongside notions of culture and identity? The aforementioned questions are some possible subjects to deal with at the conference. We are particularly interested in proposals taking a critical look at the policies exerted from the outside, or in a top-down manner, and also considering forms of resistance escaping hegemonic perspectives. We encourage proposals taking into account single cultures (ethnic groups, communities, indigenous minorities, etc.) by discussing their specificities and differences, possibly with a focus on theories and applied perspectives. Some possible subjects:\r \xe2\x80\xa2\tCultural dynamics and singular / plural belonging\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tContacts / conflicts between cultures\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tHybridization of identity and new forms of cultural belonging\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tCultural theories and geo-anthropological spaces\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tSymbolic, real or virtual spaces\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tSpatial and / or symbolic centers and peripheries\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tFood, nutrition and recognition paths\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tCities, narratives and visual imaginaries\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tEthnographic documentaries and visual representation\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tEthnographic methods, field research and Social Sciences epistemology\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tRites and cultures\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tCultures and ecological and sustainability\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tForms of mobility, tourism and identity routes\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tDiasporas and migrations\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tColonialisms and imperialisms\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tSocial resilience / resistance\r\xe2\x80\xa2\tCultures, spaces and literary forms\r  Modalities of participation and deadline:\rSend abstracts by May 30th 2022 to Leonardo Mercatanti (leonardo.mercatanti@unipa.it), Stefano Montes (stefano.montes@unipa.it) or Gaetano Sabato (gaetano.sabato@unipa.it).

The majority of these novel therapeutic approaches have been designed to potentiate the anti-tumor immune responses of T lymphocytes by acting on inhibitory or activating pathways. Although these therapies showed remarkable results, the efficacy of these treatments appears to be limited only to tumors characterized by high pre-existing T cell infiltration, the so-called \xe2\x80\x9chot\xe2\x80\x9d tumors, whereas the T-cell excluded \xe2\x80\x9ccold\xe2\x80\x9d cancers are poorly responsive.\r However, it should be highlighted that a  large proportion of tumor-associated immune cells belongs to the innate arm of the immune system, including macrophages, dendritic (DCs), myeloid cells, natural killer (NK) cells, \xce\xb3\xce\xb4 T cells and innate lymphoid cells (ILCs). All these immune populations have been demonstrated to participate to the \xe2\x80\x9cinnate sensing\xe2\x80\x9d of tumors, representing a promising target for the treatment of \xe2\x80\x9ccold\xe2\x80\x9d tumors. In particular, macrophages have emerged as an attractive therapeutic target for cancer immunotherapies as they are frequently found infiltrating the tumor bed and are involved in restraining the cytotoxic activity of T lymphocytes and, in general, the anti-tumor immune responses.\r The present Special Issue aims to collect original research articles and reviews about the role of innate cells in the tumor microenvironment and how these cells can be manipulated to boost their anti-tumor activity. Research areas may include but are not limited to: detection of tumor cells by the innate immune system, cross-talk between adaptive and innate immune cells, mechanisms of immunesupression exerted by innate immune system, novel therapeutic strategies to promote tumor cell killing by innate immune cells.  \r We are pleased to invite you to contribute in this field that is emerging extremely important in fighting cancer,  highlighting strategies that could open up new therapeutic possibilities.\r We look forward to receiving your contributions.\r Dr. Lucia Sfondrini\rDr. Valentino Mario Le Noci \rDr. Michele Sommariva\rGuest Editors\r Manuscript Submission Information\r Manuscripts should be submitted online at www.mdpi.com by registering and logging in to this website.

The tightly packed core of ancient colleges, the picturesque riverside 'Backs' (college gardens) and the leafy green meadows surrounding the city give it a more tranquil appeal than its historic rival Oxford.\rLike 'the Other Place', as Oxford is known locally, the buildings here seem unchanged for centuries, and it's possible to wander around the college buildings and experience them as countless prime ministers, poets, writers and scientists have done. Sheer academic achievement seems to permeate the very walls: cyclists loaded down with books negotiate cobbled passageways, students relax on manicured lawns and great minds debate life-changing research in historic pubs. First-time punters zigzag erratically across the river, and those long past their student days wonder what it would have been like to study in such splendid surroundings.\r \xe2\x98\x85Contact\xe2\x98\x85\rMs. Eileen Wu (Secretary Assistant)\rE-mail: icitm_icitm@outlook.com\rTel: +86-28-86527868\rMonday - Friday (09:30-18:00)\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166806"">ACBT--EI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 Asia Conference on Blockchain Technologies (ACBT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=58503"">ICEFS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n\xe3\x80\x90WOS\xe3\x80\x91\xe3\x80\x90Scopus\xe3\x80\x912022 10th International Conference on Economics, Finance and Statistics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166305"">ICII 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 9th International Conference on Information Management and Industrial Engineering (ICII 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=121886"">IOP, EI, Scopus-EMECS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Electronics, Mechanical Engineering and Computer Science (EMECS 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165451"">ICTC--Ei 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 4th Information Communication Technologies Conference (ICTC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146828"">NLPTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on NLP Techniques and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=115414"">ACM-EI/Scopus-ACAI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 5th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163027"">ICITM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 the 12th International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management (ICITM 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165449"">EEIT--Ei 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 3rd International Conference on Engineering Education and Information Technology (EEIT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

The tightly packed core of ancient colleges, the picturesque riverside 'Backs' (college gardens) and the leafy green meadows surrounding the city give it a more tranquil appeal than its historic rival Oxford.\rLike 'the Other Place', as Oxford is known locally, the buildings here seem unchanged for centuries, and it's possible to wander around the college buildings and experience them as countless prime ministers, poets, writers and scientists have done. Sheer academic achievement seems to permeate the very walls: cyclists loaded down with books negotiate cobbled passageways, students relax on manicured lawns and great minds debate life-changing research in historic pubs. First-time punters zigzag erratically across the river, and those long past their student days wonder what it would have been like to study in such splendid surroundings.\r \xe2\x98\x85Contact\xe2\x98\x85\rMs. Eileen Wu (Secretary Assistant)\rE-mail: icitm_icitm@outlook.com\rTel: +86-28-86527868\rMonday - Friday (09:30-18:00)\n\t""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166305"">ICII 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 9th International Conference on Information Management and Industrial Engineering (ICII 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163026"">ICITM--EI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 the 12th International Conference on Industrial Technology and Management (ICITM 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166806"">ACBT--EI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 Asia Conference on Blockchain Technologies (ACBT 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167403"">MSIE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 5th International Conference on Management Science and Industrial Engineering (MSIE 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Such visual representations enable direct intuitive capturing of reality, but they have weaknesses: for example, detailed visual representations bear the risk of becoming overcrowded faster than textual models and some of the visual features lack the level of precision required to create complete and unambiguous specifications. These weaknesses of graphical notations encouraged the development of text-based modeling languages that either integrate with or replace graphical notations for modeling. Typical examples of such languages are OCL, textual MOF, Epsilon, and Alloy.\r The goal of this workshop is to create a forum where researchers and practitioners interested in building models using OCL or other kinds of textual languages can directly interact, report advances, share results, identify tools for language development, and discuss appropriate standards.\r This year, MODELS workshops share a common theme of ""Modeling for social good"". Thus, we particularly encourage submissions considering the application of textual modeling to intelligent systems, and social/ethical issues.\r Topics of interest\r Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r - Mappings between textual modeling languages and other languages/formalisms\r- Mathematical models and/or formal semantics for textual modeling languages\r- Algorithms, evaluation strategies and optimizations in the context of textual modeling languages for:\r  - validation, verification, and testing,\r  - model transformation and code generation,\r  - meta-modeling and DSLs, and\r  - query and constraint specifications\r- Alternative graphical/textual notations for textual modeling languages\r- Evolution, transformation and simplification of textual modeling expressions\r- Libraries, templates and patterns for textual modeling languages\r- Tools that support textual modeling languages (e.g., verification of OCL formulae, runtime monitoring of invariants)\r- Model-driven security using textual modeling languages\r- Complexity results for textual modeling languages\r- Quality models and benchmarks for comparing and evaluating textual modeling tools and algorithms\r- Successful applications of textual modeling languages\r- Case studies on industrial applications of textual modeling languages\r- Experience reports:\r  - usage of textual modeling languages and tools in complex domains,\r  - usability of textual modeling languages and tools for end-users,\r  - applications of textual modeling in the lifecycle of intelligent systems,\r  - applications of textual modeling with a positive impact on society\r- Empirical studies about the benefits and drawbacks of textual modeling\r- Innovative textual modeling tools\r- Comparison, evaluation and integration of modeling languages\r- Correlation between modeling languages and modeling tasks\r- Reflections on the future trends of textual modeling languages and their integrity with other software development technologies\r Submissions\r Four types of submissions will be considered:\r * Presentation only submission (not included in the workshop proceedings), e.g., for already published work.

Submissions that are interdisciplinary in theory and method are welcome, especially those in popular culture, science fiction, fantasy, genre studies, critical media studies, narratology, etc. Abstracts and papers discussing recent time-travel media, approximately within the last decade, may include but are not limited to research concerning narrative structure, theme, genre, reception, comprehension, and other relevant topics.  \r Historically, time-travel films and television (TV) shows relied on science-fiction (sci-fi) tropes and storytelling devices to convey atemporal narratives. More recently, an increasing number of time-travel media have begun incorporating a variety of non-sci-fi elements to create new, increasingly complicated spins on well-worn tropes. The rapidly evolving landscape of technological advancements in our world today have made narratives dealing with the exclusive science/mechanics of time travel less of an imaginative possibility. Many viewers today seem receptive to the recycling of science-fiction time-travel tropes in many of these more traditional sci-fi narratives. However, more authors have begun creating unique adaptations on tropes such as time travel to engage audiences\xe2\x80\x99 narrative understanding in new ways, and the audiences want to see and be entertained by them. Whether this is seen as a component of hybrid genre or structural complexity, more recent time-travel media have purposefully complicated their narratives by reconditioning audiences to expect the unexpected and require audiences to learn how to engage with the story to better understand the narrative on multiple levels. \r This edited collection will demonstrate that time-travel media is more complicated now than ever before, but also that newer time-travel media has expanded into the \xe2\x80\x9cmainstream\xe2\x80\x9d of multiple narrative genres that, prior to, were predominantly superhero, fantasy, thriller, etc. Time travel now has grown into a tried and true crossover of these genres and many more, taking the necessity of \xe2\x80\x9cscience\xe2\x80\x9d out of time travel, thus constructing a fresh cultural trope that can be used by any author writing in any genre. This exploration of how a staple trope strongly tied to a single genre, like time travel was to science-fiction media, can successfully become mainstream adds to the current conversation surrounding interdisciplinary studies in areas such as critical media, genre, narrativity, and more. This exploration also aims to reveal the interdependent relationship of the time-travel trope and its malleability, the authors and their ability to make said trope believable, and the audience and their ability to suspend their disbelief and accept the use of the trope in new media and genres. \r Abstracts, up to 300 words, should present research intentions, the research\xe2\x80\x99s original contribution, and how the focus aligns with the main \xe2\x80\x9ctheme\xe2\x80\x9d of narrative complexity in this collection. All papers should be approximately 10-25 double-spaced pages following the current 9th ed. MLA style with in-text citations and Works Cited page at the end. We are currently in conversations with leading publishers and will provide more concrete publication deadline information as those decisions are finalized. \r Please submit abstracts by October 31st, 2022. \rFinal paper drafts deadline is tentatively set for August 31st, 2023. \r Please direct all abstracts, papers, and inquiries to TimeTravelCFP@gmail.com. We look forward to hearing from you and learning more about your contributions. \r Liz Trepanier, Luke Leonard, and Emory O'Malley (editors)\r\n""","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155149"">IJHAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal of Humanities, Art and Social Studies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156690"">RAMFP  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nTAA (OA) - SI: Recent Advances on Metric Fixed Point Theory 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=95801"">ICAS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n10th International Conference on Asian Studies 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166848"">RTAS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n29th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=143187"">HEC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe Inaugural Honolulu Education Conference\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=147808"">Edited Book in Springer-Verlag 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCall for Book Chapters-Machine Learning and Deep Learning for Time Series Processing and Analysis\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=89525"">LONELINESS-2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nLONELINESS -4th International Interdisciplinary Conference online\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154152"">FNP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 4th Financial Narrative Processing Workshop (FNP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165472"">ICTR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n6th International Conference on Tourism Research\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153409"">IJOE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal on Organic Electronics\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Analysis of such repositories using the traditional\rsequential implementations of Machine Learning (ML) and emerging\rtechniques, like deep learning, that model high-level abstractions in\rdata by using multiple processing layers, requires expensive\rcomputational resources and long running times.\r Parallel or distributed computing are possible approaches that can\rmake analysis of very large repositories and exploration of high-level\rrepresentations feasible. Taking advantage of a parallel or a\rdistributed execution of a ML/statistical system may: i) increase its\rspeed; ii) learn hidden representations; iii) search a larger space\rand reach a better solution or; iv) increase the range of applications\rwhere it can be used (because it can process more data, for\rexample). Parallel and distributed computing is therefore of high\rimportance to extract knowledge from massive amounts of data and learn\rhidden representations.\r The workshop will be concerned with the exchange of experience among\racademics, researchers and the industry whose work in big data and\rdeep learning require high performance computing to achieve\rgoals. Participants will present recently developed\ralgorithms/systems, on going work and applications taking advantage of\rsuch parallel or distributed environments.\r ------\rTopics\r------\r BDL 2022 invites papers on all topics in novel data-intensive\rcomputing techniques, data storage and integration schemes, and\ralgorithms for cutting-edge high performance computing architectures\rwhich targets Big Data and Deep Learning are of interest to the\rworkshop. Examples of topics include but not limited to:\r * parallel algorithms for data-intensive applications;\r* scalable data and text mining and information retrieval;\r* using Hadoop, MapReduce, Spark, Storm, Streaming to analyze Big Data;\r* energy-efficient data-intensive computing;\r* deep-learning with massive-scale datasets;\r* querying and visualization of large network datasets;\r* processing large-scale datasets on clusters of multicore and\r   manycore processors, and accelerators;\r* heterogeneous computing for Big Data architectures;\r* Big Data in the Cloud;\r* processing and analyzing high-resolution images using\r  high-performance computing;\r* using hybrid infrastructures for Big Data analysis;\r* new algorithms for parallel/distributed execution of ML systems;\r* applications of big data and deep learning to real-life problems.\r ------------------\rProgram Chairs\r------------------\r Jo\xc3\xa3o Gama, University of Porto, Portugal\rCarlos Ferreira, Polytechnic Institute of Porto, Portugal\rMiguel Areias, University of Porto, Portugal\r -----------------\rProgram Committee\r-----------------\r TBA\r ----------------\rImportant dates\r----------------\r Submission deadline: July 30, 2022(AoE)\rAuthor notification: September 2, 2022\rCamera-ready: September 12, 2022\rRegistration deadline: September 14, 2022\r ----------------\rPaper submission\r----------------\r Papers submitted to BDL 2022 must describe original research results\rand must not have been published or simultaneously submitted anywhere\relse.\r Manuscripts must follow the IEEE conference formatting guidelines and\rsubmitted via the EasyChair Conference Management System as one pdf\rfile.

Research in the fields of information systems, software engineering, computer science and information technologies is expected to address these phenomena.\r Hybrid environments are especially important in the current context, characterized by mobility restrictions, social distancing and shutdown of some in-person activities. Individuals, organizations and companies have been adjusting to this situation and have learned or enhanced learning tools, which facilitate remote worker productivity, tracking of infected people, identification of new disease variants, among others. On one side, a large amount of these initiatives were developed as a response to emergencies, i.e., reactively. On the other side, the solutions created more virtual interactions and experiences among their physical counterparts, increasing the number of hybrid environments.\r In this context, it is convenient to proactively explore the possibilities offered by new technologies to maximize the results of these hybrid environments at a short, medium and long term. Results mean not only those achieved economically but also the innovative potential that may stem from these environments, the well-being of their members or the flexibility as a competence to adapt to future changes caused by technological disruptions and other health or social emergencies.\r As in previous editions, the congress will be attended by prominent world-class speakers, who will share their vision on the topics covered in the event. Furthermore, the 5th International Conference on Systems Engineering (CIIS 2022) organizing committee invites to the presentation of seminars and academic posters showing innovative research proposals from the fields of information systems, software engineering, computer science, information technologies or others related to the event topic.\r Finally, CIIS 2022 will be held on October 18 to 20 in person and virtually to respond to the limitations that may still exist due to the COVID-19 health emergency and to offer the best experience to our participants.\r CIIS 2021 will be held on October 26, 27 and 28 of 2021 and we will provide a space of international academic scope.\r Call For Papers and Posters:\rWe welcome original papers and posters reporting on research and empirical studies in the following, but not limited to, area topics:\r Information Systems:\rE-Business\rE-Government\rEducation in Information Systems\rGlobal issues in IS\rSecurity, Privacy and Ethics in IS\rProject Management\r Software Engineering:\rSoftware Architectures\rAgile Methodologies\rRequirements Engineering\rFormal Methods\rMethodologies in Software Development\rQuality Assurance\rMobile and Ubiquous Systems\rTesting, Verification and Validation of Software\r Computer Science:\rData Structures and Algorithms\rBig Data\rBioinformatics\rComputer Graphics\rComputer Science Education\rData Mining\rHuman Computer Interaction\rArtificial Intelligence\rInformation Processing\rVirtual and Augmented Reality\rTheory of Computing\rComputational Vision\rSocial and Ethics Issues in Computing\r Information Technology\rInternet of Things\rEmbedded Systems\rCloud Computing\rSoftware define Networks\rCybersecurity\rWeb and Internet Computing\rGrid Computing\rGreen Computing\rNetworks and Communications\r Link with instructions:\rhttps://ciis.ulima.edu.pe/en/elements/call-for-papers/\r Important Dates\rPaper submission deadline: July 25, 2022\rReview committee\xe2\x80\x99s notice of acceptance and observations deadline: September 5, 2022\rFinal paper submission deadline: September 19, 2022\r \n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=115414"">ACM-EI/Scopus-ACAI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 5th International Conference on Algorithms, Computing and Artificial Intelligence (ACAI 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158804"">ACM CIIS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2022 The 5th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (CIIS 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=116286"">IEEE-Ei/Scopus-CISDS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Frontiers of Communications, Information System and Data Science (CISDS 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158805"">CIIS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2022 The 5th International Conference on Computational Intelligence and Intelligent Systems (CIIS 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152067"">AISO 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence and Soft Computing\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167676"">IEEE CCNC STP-CPS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th International Workshop on Security Trust Privacy for Cyber-Physical Systems (STP-CPS\'23) with IEEE CCNC 2023, 8-11 January, Las Vegas, NV, USA\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156554"">IEEE ICSTE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2022 12th International Conference on Software Technology and Engineering (ICSTE 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165791"">DSN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE/IFIP International Conference on Dependable Systems and Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165113"">IFToMM WC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIFToMM World Congress\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156556"">IEEE--ISCMI 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE--2022 9th Intl.

Information collected by sensors is propagated through internet-based systems and processed through the network\'s nodes. Mobile, edge and fog computing approaches have pushed advanced ""smart"" processing to the far edges of the network, while AI as a Service (AIaaS) paradigms abstract and virtualise intelligent services for deployment on the cloud. Multimedia information, including images, video streams, acoustic data and temporal series, are a relevant part of the data to be processed, analysed and understood for fully taking advantage of sensing resources.\r This workshop aims to shorten the gap between edge-based and cloud-based approaches for multimedia understanding by addressing the challenges and opportunities of the combined approach. Relevance will be given to transversal issues, such as those related to the privacy and security of such hybrid strategies, as well as to the quest for optimal and greener configuration of AI services towards sustainable and ethical use of computing resources. The co-existence of intelligent services distributed in a computational continuum made of heterogeneous nodes opens the possibilities of performing learning, including reinforcement learning, in such scenarios while coping with possible data shortages or faults of some nodes.\r Contributions addressing the above issues from a theoretical or simulation perspective are sought, while demonstrations in applicative scenarios will also be welcome.\r   *Topics* \r Topics for the workshop include, but are not limited to:\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Embedded systems and smart camera networks\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Mobile and pervasive computing\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Artificial intelligence in resource-constrained environments and on-device machine learning;\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Learning in multi-tier networked ecosystems\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Perception, sensing, and smart environment monitoring;\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Sensor fusion for environment perception;\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Video data representation, summarization, and visualization.\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Multi-view computer vision\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Learning in scarce data scenarios\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Reinforcement learning\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Fault-tolerant decision making\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Privacy and security aspects\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Explainability, trustworthiness and sustainability of pervasive AI paradigms\r \xe2\x80\xa2     Applications in\r o    Industry, smart cities and smart mobility\r o    Cultural heritage and tourism\r o    Healthcare\r   *Important dates*\r Submission deadline: July 15, 2022\r Acceptance/Reject notification: September 9, 2022\r Camera-ready: September 16, 2022\r Author Registration: September 16, 2022\r *Submission*\r Each submission should be at most 8 pages in total, including bibliography and well-marked appendices and must follow the IEEE double columns publication format available at:\r \xc2\xb7       Manuscript templates for IEEE conference proceedings\r Paper submission will only be online via: Easy Chair.\r All submitted papers will be carefully evaluated based on originality, significance, technical soundness, and clarity of expression by at least two reviewers.

The technical foundations of Cloud Computing include Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) and Virtualizations of hardware and software. The goal of Cloud Computing is to share resources among the cloud service consumers, cloud partners, and cloud vendors in the cloud value chain. The resource sharing at various levels results in various cloud offerings such as infrastructure cloud (e.g., hardware, IT infrastructure management), software cloud (e.g. SaaS focusing on middleware as a service, or traditional CRM as a service), application cloud (e.g., Application as a Service, UML modeling tools as a service, social network as a service), and business cloud (e.g., business process as a service).\r CLOUD 2022 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2022 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2022 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2022), 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2022), 2022 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2022), and 2022 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2022), 2022 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2022), and 2022 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2022).\r The technical program of CLOUD 2022 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The CLOUD 2022 tracks seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of cloud services. Research Track papers MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of Web-based services. All papers MUST properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of CLOUD, SCC, CLOUD, SERVICES, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including STBD, JWSR, STSC, STCC, STIOT and IJBPIM (see Literature Recommendations page).\r Contributions addressing all areas related to cloud computing technology, systems, applications and business innovations are solicited. CLOUD 2022 will organize refereed paper reviews in the following research areas:\r - Infrastructure As A Service (IaaS)\r- Platform As A Service (PaaS)\r- Software As A Service (SaaS)\r- Cloud Security and Privacy\r- Cloud Storage\r- Cloud Application Development\r- Cloud Performance Management\r- Industry-Specific Clouds\r- Business Models in Cloud\r- Serverless\r- 5G Cloud\r All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted and presented papers from all CLOUD tracks will appear in the conference proceedings. Extended versions of research track papers and selected application track papers will be invited for potential publication in the Services Transactions on Cloud Computing, and International Journal of Business Process Integration and Management (IJBPIM). JWSR is indexed by SCI and EI.\r Submitted Research Track and Application Track manuscripts will be limited to 15 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the LNCS Proceedings template (WORD, Latex). Submitted Short Paper track manuscripts will be limited to 8 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages. The authors can extend a maximum of 2 pages for each paper but will have to pay extra fees for each extra page. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the maximum page limit may not be reviewed. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required. Detailed instructions for electronic paper preparation and submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, workshop proposals, and review process can be found at conference site.\r The Proceedings of CLOUD 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer International Publishing AG. Currently the Abstracting and Indexing services covered by Springer\'s data feeds for LNCS proceedings include ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in Web of Science), Engineering Index EI (Compendex and Inspec databases), DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, and ZBlMath. For all 10 collocated conferences of SCF 2022, the content of this proceedings volume will be made freely accessible to anyone in the Springer\'s digital library after four years upon publication.\r At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register to the conference and present the paper. One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be granted at CLOUD 2022. The Best Paper Awards will be sponsored by Springer, which is a leading global scientific, technical and medical portfolio, providing researchers in academia, scientific institutions and corporate R&D departments with quality content through innovative information, products and services. The first author of the best student paper must be a full-time student.\r Manuscripts submitted to the Research Track focusing on application or solution descriptions may be recommended to the Application Track or other tracks for further consideration if the session slots are available.\r Author Guidelines and Templates\rSCF 2022 Guidelines & copyright forms\r Guidelines for proceedings authors (pdf)\rLNCS Copyright Form (pdf, 61kb)\rSCF 2022 Templates, sample files & useful links\r LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word 2003 Proceedings Templates (zip, 229kb)\rYour ORCID identifier\r Important Dates:\rResearch Track/Application Track/Short Paper Track:\rEarly-birds paper submission due: June 26, 2022\rReview comments to Early-birds paper submission: July 20, 2022\rRegular paper submission due: August 15, 2022\rReview comments to Regular paper submission: September 13, 2022\rCamera ready manuscripts due: September 20, 2022\rConference dates: December 10 - 14, 2022\r Submission System\r CLOUD 2022 Research Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29821&track=112949\r CLOUD 2022 Application and Industry Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29821&track=112949\r CLOUD 2022 Short Paper Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29821&track=112950\r SCF Policy\r Review Policy\r SCF Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.\r Organizers of SCF conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at a SCF conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.\r About the Services Society\r The Services Society (S2) is a non-profit professional organization that has been created to promote worldwide research and technical collaboration in services innovations among academia and industrial professionals.

Internet/Web-based services are not limited to Web services. In 2022, we will strive to advance the largest international professional forum on Web-based services.\r ICWS 2022 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2022 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2022 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2022), 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2022), 2022 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2022), and 2022 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2022), 2022 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2022), and 2022 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2022).\r From technology foundation perspective, Services Computing has become the default discipline in the modern services industry. As a major implementation technology for modernizing services industry, Web services are Internet-based programmable application components published using standard interface description languages and universally available via uniform communication protocols. The program of ICWS 2022 will continue to feature research papers with a wide range of topics, focusing on various aspects of Internet and web-based services . Some of the topics include Web services discovery and composition, Web services specifications and enhancements, Web services QoS (e.g., security, performance, reliability, fault tolerance, etc.), Web services standards and formalizations, Web services modeling, Web services engineering, Web services testing, Web services-based applications and solutions, Web services realizations, semantics in Web services, Web services supporting Cloud Computing, Web services lifecycle management, and all aspects of Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) infrastructure and middleware.\r The technical program of ICWS 2022 will include a Research Track, an Application Track, and a Short Paper Track. The ICWS 2022 tracks seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of Web-based services. Research Track papers MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of web-based technologies, applications and solutions. All papers MUST properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of ICWS, SCC, CLOUD, SERVICES, BigData, ICIOT, ICBC, EDGE, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including STBD, JWSR, STSC, STCC, STIOT and IJBPIM (see Literature Recommendations page).\r All topics relevant to Internet/Web based services are of interest. ICWS 2022 will organize refereed paper reviews in 16 research areas (themes):\r - Web-based Systems\r- Web-based Services\r- Web Programming\r- Web Content Creation\r- Social Networking Services\r- Semantic Web\r- Web Protocols\r- Web Caching and Buffering\r- Web and XML\r- Industry Specific Site Building\r- Web Testing and Stagging\r- Web User Experience\r- Thin Client Programming\r- Rich Client Programming\r- 5G Web Technology\r- Web Security and Privacy\r All submitted manuscripts will be peer-reviewed by at least 3 program committee members. Accepted and presented papers from all ICWS tracks will appear in the conference proceedings.\r Submitted Research Track and Application Track manuscripts will be limited to 15 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the LNCS Proceedings template (WORD, Latex). Submitted Short Paper track manuscripts will be limited to 8 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages. The authors can extend a maximum of 2 pages for each paper but will have to pay extra fees for each extra page. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the maximum page limit may not be reviewed. Electronic submission of manuscripts (in PDF or Word format) is required. Detailed instructions for electronic paper preparation and submission, panel proposals, tutorial proposals, workshop proposals, and review process can be found at http://icws.org/2022/.\r The Proceedings of ICWS 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer International Publishing AG.

One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be granted at ICWS 2022. The first author of the best student paper must be a full-time student. The Best Paper Awards will be sponsored by Springer, which is a leading global scientific, technical and medical portfolio, providing researchers in academia, scientific institutions and corporate R&D departments with quality content through innovative information, products and services.\r Manuscripts submitted to the Research Track focusing on application or solution descriptions may be recommended to the Application Track or other tracks for further consideration if the session slots are available.\r Author Guidelines and Templates\rSCF 2022 Guidelines & copyright forms\r Guidelines for proceedings authors (pdf)\rLNCS Copyright Form (pdf, 61kb)\rSCF 2022 Templates, sample files & useful links\r LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word 2003 Proceedings Templates (zip, 229kb)\rYour ORCID identifier\r Important Dates:\rResearch Track/Application Track/Short Paper Track:\rEarly-birds paper submission due: June 26, 2022\rReview comments to Early-birds paper submission: July 20, 2022\rRegular paper submission due: August 15, 2022\rReview comments to Regular paper submission: September 13, 2022\rCamera ready manuscripts due: September 20, 2022\rConference dates: December 10 - 14, 2022\r Submission System\r ICWS 2022 Research Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29818&track=112937\r ICWS 2022 Application and Industry Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29818&track=112936\r ICWS 2022 Short Paper Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29818&track=112938\r SCF Policy\r Review Policy\r SCF Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.\r Organizers of SCF conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at a SCF conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.\r About the Services Society\r The Services Society (S2) is a non-profit professional organization that has been created to promote worldwide research and technical collaboration in services innovations among academia and industrial professionals. Its members are volunteers from industry and academia with common interests. S2 is registered in the USA as a ""501(c) organization"", which means that it is an American tax-exempt nonprofit organization. S2 collaborates with other professional organizations to sponsor or co-sponsor conferences and to promote an effective services curriculum in colleges and universities. The S2 initiates and promotes a ""Services University"" program worldwide to bridge the gap between industrial needs and university instruction. The Services Society has formed 10 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to support technology and domain specific professional activities.\r SCF As A Platform\r As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe\'03) was held in Germany in Oct, 2003. ICWS-Europe\'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), which was held at Erfurt, Germany. SCF 2019 was held successfully in San Diego, USA. In 2020 and 2021, SCF were held as a fully virtual conference affected by the world-wide corona virus emergency. To celebrate its 20-year-old birthday, SCF 2022 will be held on December 10 - 14, 2022.\r The past 19 years, ICWS community has been expanded from Web engineering innovations to scientific research for the whole services industry. The service delivery platforms have been expanded to mobile platforms, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and edge computing. The services ecosystem is gradually enabled, value added, and intelligence embedded through enabling technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing. In the coming years, all the transactions with multiple parties involved will be transformed to blockchain.\r Based on the technology trends and best practices in the field, the Services Conference Federation (SCF) will continue serving as the conference umbrella\'s code name for all services-related conferences. SCF 2022 defines the future of New ABCDE (AI, Blockchain, Cloud, BigData & IOT) and Digital Transformation.

Companies increasingly like to focus on their core expertise area and use IT services to address all their peripheral needs. Services Computing is a new science which aims to study and better understand the foundations of this highly popular industry. It covers the science and technology of leveraging computing and information technology to model, create, operate, and manage business services. The 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022) will contribute in building the pillars of this important science and shaping the future of Services Computing. Part of the SCF 2018, SCC 2018 was successfully held on June 25 - June 30, 2018, Seattle, USA. Part of the SCF 2019, SCC 2019 was successfully held on June 25 - 30, 2019, San Diego, USA. Part of the SCF 2020 and SCF 2021, SCC 2020 and SCC 2021 were successfully held over the Internet. In 2022, we will celebrate our 2022 version of gathering, to strive to advance the largest international professional forum on all kinds of user-centric services.\r SCC 2022 is a member of Services Conference Federation (SCF). SCF 2022 will have the following 10 collocated service-oriented sister conferences: 2022 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cloud Computing (CLOUD 2022), 2022 International Conference on Services Computing (SCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Big Data (BigData 2022), 2022 International Conference on AI & Mobile Services (AIMS 2022), and 2022 World Congress on Services (SERVICES 2022), 2022 International Conference on Internet of Things (ICIOT 2022), 2022 International Conference on Cognitive Computing (ICCC 2022), 2022 International Conference on Edge Computing (EDGE 2022), and 2022 International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2022).\r The International Conference on Services Computing (SCC) covers the whole lifecycle of innovation research and enabling technologies, which includes enterprise modeling, business consulting, solution creation, services delivery, services orchestration, services optimization, services management, services marketing, services delivery and cloud computing, service-oriented architecture (SOA), business process integration and management, and Web services technologies and standards.\r All topics relevant to Internet services lifecycle are of interest. SCC 2022 will organize refereed paperreviews in 12 research areas:\r - Service Innovation Lifecycle\r- Enterprise Architectures\r- Business Process Management\r- Microservices\r- Service Oriented Architecture (SOA)\r- Business Process Integration\r- Service Composition\r- Service Delivery\r- Service Operations\r- Service Management\r- Quality of Services (QoS)\r- 5G Application Architecture\r The technical program of SCC 2022 will include a research track, a application track, and a short paper track. The SCC 2022 will highlight foundational work that strives to push beyond the limits of existing business services platforms and products, including experimental efforts, innovative systems and investigations that identify weaknesses in the existing services computing technology.\r The SCC 2022 seeks original, UNPUBLISHED research papers reporting substantive new work in various aspects of services innovation lifecycle management. Submissions MUST clearly indicate their contributions to the field of services computing and properly cite related work in the field, such as those published in the proceedings of BigData, ICWS, SCC, CLOUD, SERVICES, APSCC, ECOWS, and related journals including JWSR, STSC and IJBPIM.\r Submitted Research Track and Application Track manuscripts will be limited to 15 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages and REQUIRED to be formatted using the LNCS Proceedings template (WORD, Latex). Submitted Short Paper track manuscripts will be limited to 8 (LNCS Proceedings style) pages. The authors can extend a maximum of 2 pages for each paper but will have to pay extra fees for each extra page. Unformatted papers and papers beyond the maximum page limit may not be reviewed.\r The Proceedings of SCC 2022 will be published in the Lecture Notes in Computer Science (LNCS) by Springer International Publishing AG. Currently the Abstracting and Indexing services covered by Springer\'s data feeds for LNCS proceedings include ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in Web of Science), Engineering Index EI (Compendex and Inspec databases), DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, and ZBlMath. For all 10 collocated conferences of SCF 2022, the content of this proceedings volume will be made freely accessible to anyone in the Springer\'s digital library after four years upon publication.\r At least one author of each accepted paper is required to register to the conference and present the paper. One Best Paper award and one Best Student Paper award will be granted at SCC 2022. The first author of the best student paper must be a full-time student. The Best Paper Awards will be sponsored by Springer, which is a leading global scientific, technical and medical portfolio, providing researchers in academia, scientific institutions and corporate R&D departments with quality content through innovative information, products and services.\r Manuscripts submitted to the Research Track focusing on application or solution descriptions may be recommended to the Application Track or other tracks for further consideration if the session slots are available. \r Author Guidelines and Templates\rSCF 2022 Guidelines & copyright forms\r Guidelines for proceedings authors (pdf)\rLNCS Copyright Form (pdf, 61kb)\rSCF 2022 Templates, sample files & useful links\r LaTeX2e Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word Proceedings Templates (zip)\rMicrosoft Word 2003 Proceedings Templates (zip, 229kb)\rYour ORCID identifier\r Important Dates:\rResearch Track/Application Track/Short Paper Track:\rEarly-birds paper submission due: June 26, 2022\rReview comments to Early-birds paper submission: July 20, 2022\rRegular paper submission due: August 15, 2022\rReview comments to Regular paper submission: September 13, 2022\rCamera ready manuscripts due: September 20, 2022\rConference dates: December 10 - 14, 2022\r Submission System\r SCC 2022 Research Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29826&track=112969\r SCC 2022 Application and Industry Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29826&track=112968\r SCC 2022 Short Paper Track:\rhttps://www.edas.info/newPaper.php?c=29826&track=112970\r SCF Policy\r Review Policy\r SCF Policy and professional ethics require that referees treat the contents of papers under review as privileged information not to be disclosed to others before publication. It is expected that no one with access to a paper under review will make any inappropriate use of the special knowledge, which that access provides. Contents of abstracts submitted to conference program committees should be regarded as privileged as well, and handled in the same manner. The Conference Publications Chair shall ensure that referees adhere to this practice.\r Organizers of SCF conferences are expected to provide an appropriate forum for the oral presentation and discussion of all accepted papers. An author, in offering a paper for presentation at a SCF conference, or accepting an invitation to present a paper, is expected to be present at the meeting to deliver the paper. In the event that circumstances unknown at the time of submission of a paper preclude its presentation by an author, the program chair should be informed on time, and appropriate substitute arrangements should be made. In some cases it may help reduce no-shows for the Conference to require advance registration together with the submission of the final manuscript.\r About the Services Society\r The Services Society (S2) is a non-profit professional organization that has been created to promote worldwide research and technical collaboration in services innovations among academia and industrial professionals. Its members are volunteers from industry and academia with common interests. S2 is registered in the USA as a ""501(c) organization"", which means that it is an American tax-exempt nonprofit organization. S2 collaborates with other professional organizations to sponsor or co-sponsor conferences and to promote an effective services curriculum in colleges and universities. The S2 initiates and promotes a ""Services University"" program worldwide to bridge the gap between industrial needs and university instruction. The Services Society has formed 10 Special Interest Groups (SIGs) to support technology and domain specific professional activities.\r SCF As A Platform\r As the founding member of the Services Conference Federation (SCF), the first International Conference on Web Services (ICWS) was held in June 2003 in Las Vegas, USA. Meanwhile, the First International Conference on Web Services - Europe 2003 (ICWS-Europe\'03) was held in Germany in Oct, 2003. ICWS-Europe\'03 is an extended event of the 2003 International Conference on Web Services (ICWS 2003) in Europe. In 2004, ICWS-Europe was changed to the European Conference on Web Services (ECOWS), which was held at Erfurt, Germany. SCF 2019 was held successfully in San Diego, USA. In 2020 and 2021, SCF were held as a fully virtual conference affected by the world-wide corona virus emergency. To celebrate its 20-year-old birthday, SCF 2022 will be held on December 10 - 14, 2022.\r The past 19 years, ICWS community has been expanded from Web engineering innovations to scientific research for the whole services industry. The service delivery platforms have been expanded to mobile platforms, Internet of Things, cloud computing, and edge computing. The services ecosystem is gradually enabled, value added, and intelligence embedded through enabling technologies such as big data, artificial intelligence, and cognitive computing. In the coming years, all the transactions with multiple parties involved will be transformed to blockchain.\r Based on the technology trends and best practices in the field, the Services Conference Federation (SCF) will continue serving as the conference umbrella\'s code name for all services-related conferences. SCF 2022 defines the future of New ABCDE (AI, Blockchain, Cloud, BigData & IOT) and Digital Transformation. We are very proud to announce that SCF 2022\'s 10 co-located theme topic conferences will all center around ""services"", while each focusing on exploring different themes (web-based services, cloud-based services, Big Data-based services, services innovation lifecycle, AI-driven ubiquitous services, blockchain driven trust service-ecosystems, industry-specific services and applications, and emerging service-oriented technologies).\r SCF 2022 Highlights:\r - Bigger Platform: The 10 collocated conferences (SCF 2022) get sponsorship from the Services Society which is the world-leading not-for-profits organization (501 c(3)) dedicated for serving more than 30,000 worldwide Services Computing researchers and practitioners. Bigger platform means bigger opportunities to all volunteers, authors and participants. Meanwhile, Springer provides sponsorship to best paper awards and other professional activities. All the 10 conference proceedings of SCF 2022 will be published by Springer and indexed in ISI Conference Proceedings Citation Index (included in Web of Science), Engineering Index EI (Compendex and Inspec databases), DBLP, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Scopus, and ZBlMath.\r - Brighter Future: While celebrating 2022 version of ICWS, SCF 2022 highlights the 5th International Conference on Blockchain (ICBC 2022) to build the fundamental infrastructure for enabling secure and trusted services ecosystems. It will also lead our community members to create their own brighter future.\r - Better Model: SCF 2022 will continue to leverage the invented Conference Blockchain Model (CBM) to innovate the organizing practices for all the 10 theme conferences. Senior researchers in the field are welcome to submit proposals to serve as CBM Ambassador for an individual conference to start better interactions during your leadership practices for organizing SCF 2022.\r Look forward to your great contributions as a volunteer, author, and conference participant for the fast-growing worldwide services innovations community. If you would like to contribute to SCF 2022 as a leading volunteer or try the new Conference Blockchain Model.

This reality has become increasingly more complex in recent decades due to unprecedented changes that are occurring on a global scale. Increasingly people and families have shown greater mobility, moving across internal divisions (e.g., internal migration) and national borders either voluntarily or involuntarily. \r The resulting interactions and exchanges across societies and levels of society that result from movement and from modern communication channels have made the life circumstances of children and youth highly variable and dynamic. Such interactions influence and are in turn influenced by the social location of children, youth and families both within their own societies and the world at large. These consequent changes undoubtedly have significant implications for parenting, socialization, growing up and life opportunities afforded to children and youth around the world. \r Theme of the CCY 2022 Conference\r\xe2\x80\x9cThe Pandemic, Climate Change and Adaptation to a World in Transition: Challenges for Children and Youth\xe2\x80\x9d\r Purpose of the Conference\rCCY 2022 is designed with the purpose of serving the educational and social policy environment for Child Development and Youth Empowerment.

Multiple and interrelated reasons can be identified for this generalized rise in hunger situations, that make it challenging to monitor an extremely complex phenomenon such as food security. While great quantities of open data are available, that are related at different levels with food security, there is a urgent need to develop advanced data science techniques able to process this data in order to produce effective answers to food security related problems.\r The goal of the Open-SOFOS workshop, to be held in conjunction with ECML/PKDD 2022, is to bring together researchers and practitioners from around the world interested in developing data science techniques for food security related problems, preferably using open access data. Even though the focus is on computer science, the themes of the workshop also encourage interdisciplinary discussion about topics touching different fields such social science, humanities and geography.\rThis will allow to get an insight in the current status of research in data science for food security, showing how the possibility to exploit massive quantities of open data in this context can make it possible to improve solutions to classic tasks (e.g., the ones addressed by the existing Food Security Systems), but also to focus on research questions and practical problems that have not been deeply investigated so far.\r  TOPICS \r Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r \xe2\x80\x93\tPrediction of Food Security Indicators\r\xe2\x80\x93\tPoverty Prediction\r\xe2\x80\x93\tAgricultural Monitoring\r\xe2\x80\x93\tPrediction of Economical Indicators\r\xe2\x80\x93\tSocial Media Analysis\r\xe2\x80\x93\tEvolutionary Systems\r\xe2\x80\x93\tLandscape Analysis\r\xe2\x80\x93\tModeling of Spatial and Social Dynamics\r\xe2\x80\x93\tMobility Problems\r\xe2\x80\x93\tComplex Network Models for Food Security\r\xe2\x80\x93\tMachine and Deep Learning methods for Food Security\r\xe2\x80\x93\tText Mining Methods for Food Security\r\xe2\x80\x93\tHeterogeneous Data Integration Methods for Food Security\r\xe2\x80\x93\tKMS for Food Security\r SUBMISSION\r We welcome original contributions, either theoretical or empirical, describing ongoing projects or completed work.\rContributions can be of two types: either short position papers (up to 6 pages including references) or full research papers (up to 10 pages including references).

Although stemming from different\r  research areas in AI, such problems are often addressed with\r  algorithms that have a common goal: the effective exploration of\r  huge state spaces.  Many algorithms developed in one research area\r  are applicable to other problems, or can be hybridized with\r  techniques in other areas. Artificial Intelligence tools often\r  exploit or hybridize techniques developed by other research\r  communities, such as Operations Research.  In recent years, research\r  in Artificial Intelligence has more and more focused on experimental\r  evaluation of algorithms, the development of suitable methodologies\r  for experimentation and analysis, the study of languages and the\r  implementation of systems for the definition and solution of\r  problems.\r   Scope of the workshop is fostering the cross-fertilization of ideas\r  stemming from different areas, proposing benchmarks for new\r  challenging problems, comparing models and algorithms from an\r  experimental viewpoint, and, in general, comparing different\r  approaches with respect to efficiency, problem modeling, and ease of\r  development.\r   Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r  * Experimental evaluation of algorithms for\r       o knowledge representation\r       o automated reasoning\r       o planning\r       o scheduling\r       o machine learning\r       o model checking\r       o boolean satisfiability (SAT)\r       o constraint programming\r       o argumentation\r       o temporal reasoning\r       o combinatorial optimization\r       o quantified boolean formulae and quantified constraints\r       o modal logics\r       o logic programming\r       o answer set programming \r       o ontological reasoning       \r  * Definition and construction of benchmarks\r  * Experimentation methodologies\r  * Metaheuristics\r  * Algorithm hybridization\r  * Static analysis of combinatorial problems\r  * Languages and systems for definition and solution of problems\r  * Comparisons between systems and algorithms\r  * Application experiences (visualization, graphics, security, transports,...)\r  WORKSHOP CHAIRS\r\t Marco Maratea         University of Genova, Italy\r\t Mauro Vallati         University of Huddersfield, UK\r  HOST ORGANIZATION AND VENUE\r  University of Genova, Italy\r   The workshop will take place in Genova Nervi, Italy, in the \r  Collegio Emiliani (http://www.collegioemiliani.it/), which is a college \r  directly situated on the see.\r   Of course, we will continuously monitor the pandemic situation in \r  order to evaluate whether the conference can be indeed held as an \r  in-person event, or we will need to switch to a hybrid event, if not \r  completely on-line.\r SUBMISSIONS\r   Authors are invited to submit either original and non-original papers. \r   Publications showing negative results are welcome, provided that the\r  approach was original and very promising in principle, the\r  experimentation was well-conducted, the results obtained were\r  unforeseeable and gave important hints in the comprehension of the\r  target problem, helping other researchers to avoid unsuccessful\r  paths.\r   Workshop submissions must be in PDF format, do not exceed 15 (for\r  full papers) or 8 (for short papers) pages, and should be written in\r  LaTeX, using the LNCS style.\r   RCRA 2022 uses EasyChair for the submission of contributions.\r   Contributions must be submitted through this page:\r       https://easychair.org/conferences/?conf=rcra2022\r   All submissions will be reviewed by at least three members of the\r  program committee (TBD).\r   CONTACT\r  In case of need, the workshop co-chairs can be contacted by sending\r  an email to:\r                   marco@dibris.unige.it, M.Vallati@hud.ac.uk\r  PROCEEDINGS\r CEUR-WS Proceedings:\rAccepted original papers will be published in the AIxIA series of \rCEUR-WS AI*IA Series on CEUR-WS.org (upon authors confirmation)\r Moreover, as in some previous editions (http://rcra.aixia.it/publications),\rwe are considering the possibility of having a special issue of an \rinternational journal, provided that a sufficient amount of high quality \rpapers is collected.

To prepare for information security in the quantum computing era, post-quantum cryptosystems that are resistant to attacks from quantum computers have been built as replacements for the classical ones. Security verification of those post-quantum cryptographic protocols has got extensive attention from cryptography and security research groups in recent years.\rNote that due to Covid-19, the workshop may be held in a hybrid style or completely virtual.\r TOPICS OF INTEREST\rAuthors are invited to submit papers describing original and unpublished work somehow related to formal analysis and verification of post-quantum cryptographic protocols. Topics of interest include, but are not limited to:\r- Post-quantum cryptsystems\r- Post-quantum cryptographic protocols\r- Logics of quantum computing/algorithms/programs\r- Formal analysis/verification of those related to the above-mentioned\r PUBLICATION\rProceedings shall be submitted to CEUR-WS.org (http://ceur-ws.org/) for online publication. Therefore, authors are supposed to use the CEUR-ART template style for preparing papers. In addition to regular papers (12 - 16 pages), authors are also recommended to submit short papers (6 - 8 pages), such as work-in-progress ones and tool demonstration ones. Papers submitted as regular papers may be accepted as short papers.

RTSS\xe2\x80\x9922, celebrating the 43rd anniversary of the event, continues the trend of making RTSS an expansive and inclusive event, striving to embrace new and emerging areas of real-time systems research.\r RTSS\xe2\x80\x9922 welcomes submissions of high-quality, original research papers related to both real-time systems\xe2\x80\x99 theory and practice. Submissions can go to either the real-time systems track (Track 1) or the design and applications track (Track 2) which covers Cyber-Physical Systems, HW-SW integration and system-level design, and Internet of Things (IoT). To be in scope, ALL submissions must address some form of real-time requirements such as deadlines, response times or delay/latency. All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings.\r RTSS especially welcomes new and emerging topics provided that they address some aspects of real-time requirements as stated above. Such topics may include machine learning techniques for the design and analysis of real-time systems, system design approaches for achieving real-time machine learning, resource management in autonomous systems, system-level solutions for real-time applications exploiting domain-specific accelerators, etc.\r Note the above list of topics is intended only as a rough guide and should not be understood as an exclusive list. Papers breaking new ground, departing from established subfields, or challenging the status quo are most welcome and are encouraged.\r Empirical survey-based research focused on the real-time systems field is also welcome. This type of research uses surveys, questionnaires, interviews, use-cases or other empirical techniques to obtain information about the past / current / future state of play in the research, design, development, verification, validation, and deployment of real-time systems. (Note literature surveys that classify, review, and summarize existing research papers are not considered empirical research and are not in scope of the conference).\r All accepted papers will appear in the main program and proceedings. A selection of papers will receive recognition as outstanding papers, and will be highlighted as such in the proceedings. Best paper and best student paper awards will be presented at the conference, along with an award for the best presentation. (Note that submissions are eligible for the best student paper award provided that the first author is a student as of the submission deadline).\r Track 1: Real-Time Systems Track\r The objective of this track is to promote cutting-edge research in real-time systems, especially new and emerging topics. Areas of interest include, but are not limited to the following: operating systems, networks, middleware, compilers, tools, scheduling, QoS support, resource management, testing and debugging, design and verification, modeling, WCET analysis, performance analysis, fault tolerance, security, and system experimentation and deployment experiences.\r Track 2: Design and Applications Track\r This track aims to highlight the newest research achievements in designs, implementations and applications that must attend to some aspects of real-time requirements. Continuing with the success in previous years, the track will particularly focus on four specialized areas:\r Cyber-Physical Systems\r CPS applications (such as transportation, healthcare, industrial control, etc.) interact with the physical worlds. Hence, they do possess real-time requirements. Papers that identify scientific foundations and technologies that advance the state-of-the-art for CPS are welcome. Topics of interest include (but are not limited to) foundations of CPS, design methods, simulation/emulation for CPS, tool chains, CPS architectures, security and privacy, hardware/software compositions that include physical components, performance analysis, robustness and safety, and analysis techniques and tools especially those with multiple temporal and spatial scales.\r HW-SW Integration and System\xe2\x80\x93Level Design\r This area focuses on design methodologies and tools for hardware/software integration and co-design of modern embedded systems for real-time applications. Topics include (but are not limited to) architecture description languages and tools, hardware architectures, design space exploration, synthesis and optimization. Of special interest are SoC design for real-time applications, special-purpose functional units, specialized memory structures, multi-core chips and communication aspects, FPGA simulation and prototyping, software simulation and compilation for novel architectures and applications, as well as power, thermal, timing and predictability analyses.\r Internet of Things (IoT)\r Grand challenges in IoT include extremely constrained resources (energy supply, storage and computational power) in IoT devices, unprecedented scalability requirements as well as uncertain dynamics in their operating environments. Submissions that build on solid theoretical foundations, present empirical development, and experimental evaluations for empowering IoT applications with real-time requirements are welcome.\r Paper Submissions\r Submitted papers must describe original work not previously published or concurrently submitted elsewhere. Papers based on previous work presented at workshops are eligible for submission \xe2\x80\x93 if the workshop paper has a digital object identifier (DOI) then the submission must contain at least 30% new material. All submitted papers must comply with the double-blind submission requirements. The main body of each submitted paper is limited to 11 pages of technical content with additional pages permitted for bibliography only. Submissions must be formatted according to IEEE conference paper guidelines.\r To submit a paper please visit: http://2022.rtss.org/submission/\r \n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166848"">RTAS 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n29th IEEE Real-Time and Embedded Technology and Applications Symposium\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167074"">WMC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nWorkshop on Mixed Criticality Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158528"">DS-RT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nIEEE/ACM 26th International Symposium on Distributed Simulation and Real Time Applications (DS-RT)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154371"">IWCPS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n9th International Workshop on Cyber-Physical Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161127"">IJPLA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal of Programming Languages and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160854"">RTCAC 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe International Workshop on Real-time Cybersecurity Analysis in the Cloud\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158917"">RTSOPS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n11th International Real-Time Scheduling Open Problems Seminar \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=138873"">NG-RES 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nNG-RES: Workshop on Next Generation Real-Time Embedded Systems\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166513"">HPG 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nHigh Performance Graphics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154987"">KommA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nKommunikation in der Automation\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Recent years have witnessed an increased interest from the vision and graphics communities in these fundamental topics of research. Not only has there been a constantly growing flow of related papers, but also substantial progress has been achieved.\r Each step forward eases the use of images by people or computers for the fulfillment of further tasks, as image manipulation serves as an important frontend. Not surprisingly then, there is an ever growing range of applications in fields such as surveillance, the automotive industry, electronics, remote sensing, or medical image analysis etc. The emergence and ubiquitous use of mobile and wearable devices offer another fertile ground for additional applications and faster methods.\r This workshop aims to provide an overview of the new trends and advances in those areas. Moreover, it will offer an opportunity for academic and industrial attendees to interact and explore collaborations.\r This workshop builds upon the success of the Advances in Image Manipulation (AIM) workshop at ICCV 2019, 2021 and ECCV 2020, the Mobile AI (MAI) workshop at CVPR 2021, 2022, the Perceptual Image Restoration and Manipulation (PIRM) workshop at ECCV 2018, the workshop and Challenge on Learned Image Compression (CLIC) editions at CVPR 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and the New Trends in Image Restoration and Enhancement (NTIRE) editions: at CVPR 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021 and 2022 and at ACCV 2016. Moreover, it relies on the people associated with the PIRM, MAI, CLIC, and NTIRE events such as organizers, PC members, distinguished speakers, authors of published papers, challenge participants and winning teams.\r  TOPICS\r Papers addressing topics related to image/video manipulation, restoration and enhancement are invited. The topics include, but are not limited to:\r \xe2\x97\x8f    Image-to-image translation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Video-to-video translation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video manipulation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Perceptual manipulation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video generation and hallucination\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video quality assessment\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video semantic segmentation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Perceptual enhancement\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Multimodal translation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Depth estimation\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video inpainting\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video deblurring\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video denoising\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video upsampling and super-resolution\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video filtering\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video de-hazing, de-raining, de-snowing, etc.\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Demosaicing\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video compression\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Removal of artifacts, shadows, glare and reflections, etc.\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video enhancement: brightening, color adjustment, sharpening, etc.\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Style transfer\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Hyperspectral imaging\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Underwater imaging\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Aerial and satellite imaging\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Methods robust to changing weather conditions / adverse outdoor conditions\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video manipulation on mobile devices\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Image/video restoration and enhancement on mobile devices\r\xe2\x97\x8f    Studies and applications of the above.\r  SUBMISSION\r  A paper submission has to be in English, in pdf format, and at most 14 pages (excluding references) in single-column, ECCV style. The paper format must follow the same guidelines as for all ECCV 2022 submissions.\r The review process is double blind. Authors do not know the names of the chair/reviewers of their papers. Reviewers do not know the names of the authors.\r Dual submission is not allowed. If a paper is submitted also to ECCV and accepted, the paper cannot be published both at the ECCV and the workshop.\r For the paper submissions, please go to the online submission site \rhttps://cmt3.research.microsoft.com/AIMWC2022/\r   WORKSHOP DATES\r \xe2\x97\x8f Submission Deadline: July 25, 2022\r\xe2\x97\x8f Decisions: August 15, 2022\r\xe2\x97\x8f Camera Ready Deadline: August 22, 2022\r  AIM 2022 has the following associated challenges (ONGOING!):\r \xe2\x97\x8f Compressed Input Super-Resolution\r\xe2\x97\x8f Reversed ISP\r\xe2\x97\x8f Instagram Filter Removal\r\xe2\x97\x8f Video Super-Resolution (Evaluation platform: MediaTek Dimensity APU) - Powered by MediaTek\r\xe2\x97\x8f Image Super-Resolution (Eval. platform: Synaptics Dolphin NPU) - Powered by Synaptics\r\xe2\x97\x8f Learned Smartphone ISP (Eval. platform: Snapdragon Adreno GPU) - Powered by OPPO\r\xe2\x97\x8f Bokeh Effect Rendering (Eval. platform: ARM Mali GPU) - Powered by Huawei\r\xe2\x97\x8f Depth Estimation (Eval. platform: Raspberry Pi 4) - Powered by Raspberry Pi \r  PARTICIPATION\r To learn more:\rhttps://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim22/\r   ORGANIZERS (to be announced)\r     \xe2\x97\x8f Radu Timofte (University of W\xc3\xbcrzburg, Germany and ETH Z\xc3\xbcrich, Switzerland)\r   SPEAKERS (to be announced)\r  SPONSORS (to be announced)\r     JMU Wurzburg / CAIDAS\r    ETH Zurich / CVL\r  CONTACT\r Email: radu.timofte [at] uni-wuerzburg.de\rWebsite: https://data.vision.ee.ethz.ch/cvl/aim22/\r \n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=154700"">ECCV 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n European Conference on Computer Vision\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165806"">FL-NeurIPS 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Workshop on Federated Learning: Recent Advances and New Challenges in Conjunction with NeurIPS 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152256"">IJCNN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Joint Conference on Neural Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=58199"">AIM@EPIA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nArtificial Intelligence in Medicine\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=121887"">IOP, EI, Scopus-PRECE 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 International Conference on Power, Renewable Energy and Control Engineering (PRECE 2022)-EI Compendex\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156690"">RAMFP  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nTAA (OA) - SI: Recent Advances on Metric Fixed Point Theory 2022\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=118184"">ICVISP 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2022 6th International Conference on Vision, Image and Signal Processing (ICVISP 2022)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

The global AI market was valued at USD $62.35 billion in 2020 and is expected to grow with an annual growth rate of 40.2% from 2021 to 2028. Although AI is solving real-world challenges and transforming industries, there are serious concerns about its ability to make decisions in a responsible way, touching on lives and human values. Responsible AI is one of the greatest scientific challenges of our time and societies.\r In addition to existing and emerging regulations, many ethical principles and guidelines for responsible AI have also been issued by governments, research organizations, and enterprises. However, high-level regulations and ethical principles are far from ensuring the trustworthiness of AI systems. The issues go beyond traditional software code \xe2\x80\x9cbugs\xe2\x80\x9d and theoretical guarantees for algorithms. They require full lifecycle operationalized quality, regulatory compliance and ethical assurances from a software-engineering perspective. And even for a highly trustworthy AI system, gaining the trust from individuals, domain experts, and wider communities is another challenge that must be addressed carefully for the AI system to be widely accepted.\r In this special issue, we are looking for cutting-edge software-engineering methods, techniques, tools, and real-world case studies that can help operationalize responsible AI. Topics of interests include, but are not limited to:\r Requirement engineering for responsible AI\r - Software architecture and design of responsible AI systems\r- Software verification and validation for responsible AI systems\r- DevOps, AIOps, and MLOps for responsible AI systems\r- Development processes for responsible AI systems\r- Governance of responsible AI\r- Software engineering for explainable AI\r- Reproducibility and traceability of AI\r- Trust and trustworthiness of AI systems\r- Human-centric AI systems and human values in AI systems\r Submission Guidelines\r For author information and guidelines on submission criteria, please visit the Author Information page.

Signal-producing procedures by microscopes, spectrometers and other sensors have found their way into wide fields of medicine, biotechnology, economy and environmental analysis. With this arises the problem of the automatic mass analysis of signal information. Signal-interpreting systems which generate automatically the desired target statements from the signals are therefore of compelling necessity. The continuation of mass analyses on the basis of the classical procedures leads to investments of proportions that are not feasible. New procedures and system architectures are therefore required. The scope of conference is to bring together researcher, praticioners and industry people who are dealing with mass analysis of images and signals to present and discuss recent research in these fields. \r The goals of this conference are to:\r * provide a forum for identifying important contributions and opportunities for research    \r  on mass data analysis of signals and images,\r* promote the systematic study of how to apply automatic signal/image analysis and \r  interpretation procedures to that field\r* show case applications of mass data analysis in biology, medicine, and chemistry.\r Topics of interest include (but are not limited to):\r     Applications in Medicine, r/g/b Biotechnology, Food Industries and Dietetics, \r    Biometry and Agriculture\r    Techniques and developments of signal and image producing procedures\r    Object matching and object tracking in microscopic and video microscopic images\r    1D, 2D and 3D shape analysis and description\r    1D, 2D and 3D feature extraction of texture, structure and location\r    Algorithms for 1D, 2D and 3D signal analysis and interpretation\r    Image segmentation algorithms\r    Parallelization of image analysis and interpretation algorithms\r    Semantic tagging of microscopic images\r    Applications in medicine, biotechnology, chemistry and others\r    Applications in crystallography\r    Applications in proteomics\r    Applications in 2D and 3D cell images analysis\r    Image Acquisition procedures for mass data analysis\r    Methods and solutions for biometrical systems (Face-, Iris and Fingerprint \r    Recognition)\r    Recognition methods for moving objects (face, iris, body)\r    Methods for data encryption (e.g. crypotographic methods, watermarking)\r Important Dates\rDeadline for paper submission: February 15, 2023\rNotification of acceptance: March 18, 2023\rSubmission of camera-ready copy: April 05, 2023\r Authors can submit their papers via an on-line reviewing system.: Please submit the PDF-File of your camera-ready paper through the COMMENCE conference management system (http://www.mda-signals.de/CMS/).

Multiple online, blended, and hybrid delivery modes have become the norm, with wide-ranging resources being allocated and infrastructure being established to enable learners to access online learning activities and promote instructor-learner and learner-learner interaction when learning online. With greater accessibility to e-learning, there is a clear route for the next generation of e-learners. In the post COVID-19 era, one can expect an increasing need for pedagogically sound and adaptive e-learning environments with high capacity and maneuverability to supplement the resumed learning after the pandemic. In the near future, the integration of information and communication technologies, artificial intelligence, augmented and virtual reality, and gamification into instruction and learning will be further enhanced, making e-learning a vital component of school learning. Traditional offline learning and e-learning would go hand in hand, improving the learning experiences for learners of all ages.\r This special session, Intelligent E-learning at Post-COVID19 Era (IEPCE), aims to discuss the development and implementation of intelligent e-learning models with high scalability and adaptability in the post-COVID era. We also call on investigating e-learning adaptation and learning environment optimization for effective and rapid response to future pandemics like the COVID19 pandemic. Topics of interest in the special issue of IEPCE include but are not limited to the following:\r AI, AR/VR, and gamification for intelligent e-learning.\rOnline education in the post COVID-19 era.\rMOOC\xe2\x80\x99s innovative development in the post-COVID-19 era.\rDeep neural networks for smart e-learning.\rHybrid or blended e-learning.\rTeaching and learning evaluation in the post COVID-19 era.\rIntegration of offline learning and e-learning in the post COVID-19 era.\rTechnology proficiency development.\rScalable and easily adaptable e-learning models.\rCollaborative and inclusive e-learning.\rStudent modeling for intelligent e-learning.\rChallenges and opportunities for e-learning in the post COVID-19 era.\rE-learning adaptation and optimization to unexpected crises.\r   REVIEW PROCESS AND INDEX\r--------------------------\rEach paper will be reviewed by at least two programme committee members, and final decisions are given by the guest editorial board based on the scores given by the reviewers of this special issue.

Game-based learning is a broad field of research and practice and contains under its umbrella for example the following key concepts: educational games, serious games, gamification of learning, games-with-a-purpose, science games, simulation games, and smart toys.\r Gamefulness has increasingly become an integral part of any learning and education, and its rise is based on the premise that games are able to invoke beneficial engagement, interest, and motivation as well as cognitive, emotional, and social skill development.\r To advance the literature on GBL, this minitrack encourages submissions from any disciplinary background reporting different kinds of studies: e.g., empirical studies, case studies, methods and techniques, conceptual frameworks, and literature reviews. Beyond the title of the minitrack, the minitrack covers research and practice framed as related to neighboring concepts such as educational games, serious games, gamified learning, single- and multiplayer games for learning, simulation, and training games, gameful design, etc. Studies should cover, but are not limited to, the following issues:\r - Users: e.g., studies on the effects of GBL on usability, engagement, experience, motivations, user/player types, individual differences, user modeling, etc.\r- Educational science: educational effectiveness of GBL, educational theories and their application in GBL, games as assessment tools, games as educational research tools, pedagogical models for GBL, instructional design of GBL, learning mechanisms in GBL, emotions and affective interaction.\r- Computing: Computational aspects involving GBL, e.g., tangible and physical computing, artificial intelligence / data-driven approaches, algorithms, frameworks, architectures, etc.\r- Technology: e.g., GBL in mobile games, procedural content generation, etc.\r- Arts & Design: e.g., user interface design, emotional design, design of learning mechanics, mapping instructional methods to game mechanics, inclusive design and accessibility issues, narratives, media, and & languages in GBL, localization in GBL, .\r- Culture: e.g., socio-cultural relations involving GBL, Anthropology, and poetics in GBL, bodies, gender, and politics in GBL, etc.\r- Pedagogy: pedagogical aspects (e.g., personalization, collaborative learning, blended learning, cognitive process, intellectual skills, edutainment, etc) in GBL.\r- Learning analytics: e.g., adaptivity and personalization in GBL, studies involving GBL in the learning analytics process, game-mechanics adaptation based on learning data.\r- Health: GBL for health, effects of GBL in health, health literacy, behavioral change..\r- Theories/concepts/methods: e.g., contributions to science around GBL\r- Ethics: i.e., general ethical aspects involving GBL.\r Authors of accepted papers have the option to fast-track extended versions of their HICSS papers to:\r - Smart Learning Environments\r- Internet Research\r- AIS Transactions on Human-Computer Interaction\r- Frontiers in AI for Human Learning and Behavior Change\r Minitrack Co-Chairs:\r Wilk Oliveira (Primary Contact)\rTampere University\rwilk.oliveira@tuni.fi\r Juho Hamari\rTampere University\rjuho.hamari@tuni.fi\r Kristian Kiili\rTampere University\rkristian.kiili@tuni.fi\r Julita Vassileva\rUniversity of Saskatchewan\rjiv@cs.usask.ca\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165144"">EAIT-SI Immersive Learning -- Scopus,JCR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nSpringer EAIT - Special Issue on Disruption, Innovation and Resiliency in Immersive Learning\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=162591"">HICSS Cellular+Wireless Nets 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nCellular and WIreless Networks minitrack of the 2023 Hawaii International Conference on Systems Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=156822"">AIA 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nArtificial Intelligence-based Assistants Minitrack, HICSS 56\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=158527"">Esports HICSS  2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEsports at the 56th Hawaii International Conference on System Sciences\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166842"">MDM special issue 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nMDM special issue: Diagnosis of early Alzheimer\'s disease based on Artificial Intelligence\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153586"">CFP IJFMA Vol 8 No 1 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nNEW DEADLINE !!

Digital assets are anything that are digitally unique items or objects such as digital arts, videos, in-game items, music, documents, and signatures. The public and media's attention to the NFTs has been exploding and the NFT marketplace has been expanding in both volume and value tremendously. Blockchain network provides an underlying technology to secure only one official ownership at a time and trading interface to prevent illegal copying and downloads through smart contracts on blockchain networks such as Ethereum. Any assets either digital or physical, theoretically, can be digitized in such a way not to be replicated as a proof of the uniqueness and for protection of the ownership. NFT technology ultimately provides a solution to the issues of internet of assets with respect to illegal copying and distribution of items or objects violating required security and privacy protocols. From the systems perspective, the standards for NFT such as ERC-721 and ERC-1155 have been developed and exercised in the market such that NFT for digital items and objects are minted through smart contracts in a unique way in terms of ownership, copyright, reproduction right and ownership transfer, to mention a few. Minting an NFT is conforming to the token standards ERC-721 and/or ERC-1155 interfacing through smart contracts that prove ownership transferring. As the NFT market is expanding, NFT technology is expected to be more extensively employed to prove the scarcity of creating an NFT, the transparency of trading an NFT, and the uniqueness of the ownership of an NFT. Also, NFT can be exercised to ensure ownerships of full or some sectors of the digitized and secure documents such as Intellectual Property, Patent, and License.\r The workshop welcomes original research, related idea, and innovative solutions and focus on either fundamental methodological studies or use cases and application demonstrations.

Besides their popularity, blockchain platforms (particularly, Bitcoin) suffer from significant energy consumption (overtaking all other areas in the IT sector). In this workshop, we aim to explore the potential applications of blockchain and DLT to energy systems, as well as to address its energy efficiency issue. \r This workshop will feature the following keynote speakers: \r - Zhao Yang Dong (NTU): Blockchain-enabled Security Systems for Smart Grids\r- \xc3\x9cmit Cali (NTNU): DLT Meets Energy - Current & Future Perspectives\r- Srinivasan Keshav (Univ. Cambridge): Bringing Trust to Carbon Credits Through Computer Science\r- Jos R\xc3\xb6ling (IBM Consulting): Programmable Energy \r There will also be panel discussions of hot topics, such as \xe2\x80\x9cShall we ban Proof-of-Work?\xe2\x80\x9d, \xe2\x80\x9cIs DLT a practical solution for the energy sector?\xe2\x80\x9d\r **Free Registration** The zoom link for participation can be found at https://EnergyDLT.github.io/\r For any questions, please contact the Host: Sid Chi-Kin Chau (Australian National University)\r  Please find more information on the Workshop Website: https://EnergyDLT.github.io/\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=161144"">ICBDSC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 the 6th International Conference on Big Data and Smart Computing (ICBDSC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=149128"">IJCSA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Journal on Computational Science &amp; Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167022"">INTOP@ACM SAC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInteroperability (INTOP) at the 38th ACM/SIGAPP Symposium on Applied Computing (ACM SAC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=144738"">CSEA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n8th International Conference on Computer Science, Engineering and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166668"">PLDI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 44th ACM SIGPLAN Conference on Programming Language Design and Implementation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152802"">BDHI  2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n4th International Conference on Big Data &amp; Health Informatics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166667"">ESEC/FSE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe ACM Joint European Software Engineering Conference and Symposium on the Foundations of Software Engineering\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=150019"">EEIJ 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nElectrical Engineering: An International Journal \n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166563"">ACM ICHMI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 3rd International Conference on Human\xe2\x80\x93Machine Interaction (ICHMI 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167734"">ACM ESCC 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nACM--2023 European Symposium on Computer and Communications (ESCC 2023)\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Similar to last year, accepted papers will be included into proceedings that will be indexable by major academic search engines (e.g., Google Scholar). \r Submitted papers should be formatted in a single column format in 12-point format, single spaced. While there is no \xe2\x80\x9chard\xe2\x80\x9d limit to the length of the papers, we encourage authors not to exceed 12 pages (preferred length 6-10 pages). The presentation of the content should be concise and precise to help reviewers judge papers on their methodological novelty and contributions to a particular application of security. Each paper will undergo a double-blind review and will be considered for publication in the proceedings and as a talk or as a poster. A full paper is not required. Authors are also welcome to submit a two-page extended abstract that would be considered for inclusion in the program as a talk or as a poster (the latter option is in the same manner as prior years of CAMLIS). \rThe data, representations, model settings, evaluation set up, and performance metrics should all be clearly described in the submissions. While not required, authors are strongly encouraged to provide the code, documentation, and data from their research in a publicly accessible format or repository (e.g., GitHub). This will help to facilitate scientific reproducibility of impactful research within our community and help to generate innovative research in a timelier and streamlined manner. \r Accepted talks will be presented as talks of 20 minutes in length with up to 10 minutes of discussion period after each talk. Talks will also be recorded and made publicly available after the conference. The poster session will be held live and in person during the CAMLIS event. \r We encourage participation from academics working in information security, government research labs, national laboratories, and FFRDCs, and information security data scientists in industry.\r Important dates are:\r\xc2\xb7Friday, August 5, 2022: Submission deadline\r\xc2\xb7Friday, September 9, 2022: Speakers notified\r\xc2\xb7Thursday \xe2\x80\x93 Friday, October 20 \xe2\x80\x93 21, 2022: Conference\rImportant websites are:\r\xc2\xb7Conference website: https://www.camlis.org/ \r\xc2\xb7Submission link: https://openreview.net/group?id=camlis.org/CAMLIS/2022/Conference  \r Venue: Sands Capital Management, 1000 Wilson Boulevard, 30th Floor, Arlington, VA 22209\r\n'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=137130"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n18th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=152256"">IJCNN 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nInternational Joint Conference on Neural Networks\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=151014"">ISIR-eCom 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nINTERACTIVE AND SCALABLE INFORMATION RETRIEVAL METHODS FOR ECOMMERCE ((conjunction with WSDM 2022)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165881"">IDITR-Chengdu 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n2023 2nd International Conference on Innovations and Development of Information Technologies and Robotics (IDITR 2023)\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163191"">ECIR 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n45th European Conference on Information Retrieval\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=165855"">IPCAI 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe International Conference on Information Processing in Computer-Assisted Interventions\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=146828"">NLPTA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n3rd International Conference on NLP Techniques and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153664"">AIAA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n12th International Conference on Artificial Intelligence, Soft Computing and Applications\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155978"">IEEE ICA 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nThe 6th IEEE International Conference on Agents\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163215"">MLDM 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n19th International Conference on Machine Learning and Data Mining\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Furthermore, there is a great deal of confusion about how the\rdisease is transmitted, detected, and treated. More research and tests are needed to determine how it\rspreads, as well as preventative and immunization difficulties. Many effective and efficient solutions can be\rachieved using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and computer-assisted paradigms. Smart cities infrastructure\rcurrently contains multiple smart devices with sensing and data routing capabilities that connect with one\ranother using various protocols, allowing disease updates to be obtained at any time and from any\rlocation. These devices have the ability to provide novel services that would not otherwise be possible.\rInnovative research should offer light on how mobile Internet, big data, artificial intelligence, cloud\rcomputing, and other modern information technology can be used to create the necessary online and cost-effective medical service platforms. Indeed, Decision Support Systems (DSS) and Healthcare Information\rTechnology are undeniably hot areas that will require in-depth study and research, as well as the scientific\rcommunity\xe2\x80\x99s attention.\r  ***\rGeneral Chair\rJos\xc3\xa9 Machado\rCentro Algoritmi, University of Minho\r General Co-Chair\rHugo Peixoto\rUniversity of Minho\r Technical Program Committee Chairs\rJos\xc3\xa9 Luis Calvo Rolle\rUniversity of A Coru\xc3\xb1a\r Gianni Vercelli\rDIBRIS \xe2\x80\x93 Universit\xc3\xa0 di Genova\r Technical Program Committee Co-Chairs\rDeden Jacob\rTelkom University\r Ichiro Satoh\rNational Institute of Informatics, Japan\r ***\r PUBLICATION\r All registered papers will be submitted for publishing by Springer and made available through SpringerLink Digital Library.\r Proceedings will be submitted for inclusion in leading indexing services, such as Web of Science, Compendex, Scopus, DBLP, EU Digital Library, Google Scholar, IO-Port, MathSciNet, Inspec, and Zentralblatt MATH.\r Publication opportunities:\r EAI Transactions series (Open Access)\rEAI/Springer Innovations in Communications and Computing Book Series\r(titles in this series are indexed in Ei Compendex, Web of Science & Scopus)\r ***\r TOPICS:\r - AI in the Internet of Medical Things (IoMT)\r- AI in IoT-oriented medical applications\r- AI and IoT paradigms in sustainable education systems\r- AI/IoT solutions in smart cities traffic systems\r- Deep Learning for COVID-19 and alike diagnosis\r- Neural Network for medical diagnosis\r- AI-oriented in hospital and online diagnosis\r- Collaboration of Image Progressing and ML for COVID-19 and alike diagnosis\r- Collaboration of Computer Communication and ML for COVID-19 and alike diagnosis\r- Use cases of computer-assisted COVID-19 and alike detection systems\r- COVID-19 Patient Care and Treatment using ML-oriented systems\r- Emerging Networks solutions for improved medical diagnosis results\r- Intelligent Hardware solutions for COVID-19 and alike diagnosis\r- Effective use of computer communication and ML for solving open medical problems\r- Healthcare standards and onthologies for effective information systems implementation such as OpenEHR,\r- Snomed and FHIR\r- Next Generation Networks (NGNs) and ML solutions for medical diagnosis\r- Security and privacy aspects in medical diagnosis\r ***\r This event is organized by EAI (www.eai.eu).\r EAI \xe2\x80\x93 European Alliance for Innovation is a non-profit organization and a professional community established in cooperation with the European Commission to empower global research and innovation, and to promote cooperation between European and International ICT communities.\n\t'","b'<div align=""left"" class=""cfp"">\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""0"" cellspacing=""0px"" width=""100%"">\n<tr valign=""top"">\n<td>\n<table align=""center"" cellpadding=""4"" cellspacing=""3"" width=""100%"">\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167093"">HEALTHINF 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n16th International Conference on Health Informatics\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157202"">EAI TRIDENTCOM 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n17th EAI International Conference on Tools for Design, Implementation and Verification of Emerging Information Technologies\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=155961"">HIIJ 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nHealth Informatics: An International Journal\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=160470"">EAI ArtsIT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n11th EAI International Conference: ArtsIT, Interactivity &amp; Game Creation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=167099"">ICT4AWE 2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n9th International Conference on Information and Communication Technologies for Ageing Well and e-Health\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157203"">EAI DLI  2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n7th EAI International Conference on Design, Learning &amp; Innovation\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=157206"">EAI PervasiveHealth 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\nEAI PervasiveHealth 2022 - 16th EAI International Conference on Pervasive Computing Technologies for Healthcare\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=166797"">EAI ICMTEL  2023</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n5th EAI International Conference on Multimedia Technology and Enhanced Learning\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=163116"">ICISML 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n1st EAI International Conference on Intelligent Systems and Machine Learning\n</td></tr>\n<tr><td>\n<a href=""/cfp/servlet/event.showcfp?eventid=153578"">EAI SmartGIFT 2022</a>\xc2\xa0\xc2\xa0\n7th EAI International Conference on Smart Grid and Innovative Frontiers in Telecommunications\n</td></tr>\n</table>\n</td>\n</tr>\n</table>\n</div>'"

Segovia (Saint Louis University, Madrid Campus, Spain).\r DESCRIPTION\r As Gilles Deleuze writes, through conceptual personae concepts are not only thought but also perceived and felt. They are philosophical sensibilia which often play a part in the production and the definition of new concepts. Mythical figures, science-fiction motifs, landscape impersonations\xe2\x80\xa6 Conceptual personae are polymorphous and pervasive. Think, for example, in Nietzsche\xe2\x80\x99s take on Apollo and Dionysus as meta-philosophical images; in Ihab Hassan\xe2\x80\x99s reuse of the myth of Orpheus\xe2\x80\x99s dismemberment to define postmodernism; or, more recently, in Haraway\xe2\x80\x99s reuse of the Lovecraftian Cthulhu to mark the return of the chthonic in the limes of the Anthropocece, and in Povinelli\xe2\x80\x99s triangulation of the Desert, the Animist, and the Virus to map the open renegotiation of what is life and non-life today. In short conceptual personae can function as icons, indexes, or symbols for thinking, and thus can also play a major role in the making of an ontology of the present and its margins, that is, in helping to figure out what the present is and what it can eventually become, in the short and the long run, under the sign of the Otherwise. Papers exploring existing conceptual personae and/or proposing new ones in any territory relevant to the philosophical analysis of the present and its futurability are thus welcome.\r  Authors publishing their articles in the special issue will benefit from:\r \xc2\xb7 transparent, comprehensive and fast peer review,\r \xc2\xb7 efficient route to fast-track publication and full advantage of De Gruyter\'s e-technology,\r \xc2\xb7 free language assistance for authors from non-English speaking regions.\r Because Open Philosophy is published under an Open Access model, as a rule, publication costs should be covered by so called Article Publishing Charges (APC), paid by authors, their affiliated institutions, funders or sponsors.\r Authors without access to publishing funds are encouraged to discuss potential discounts or waivers with Managing Editor of the journal Katarzyna Tempczyk (katarzyna.tempczyk@degruyter.com) before submitting their manuscripts.\r  HOW TO SUBMIT\r Submissions will be collected by June 15, 2022. There are no specific length limitations.\r To submit an article for the special issue of Open Philosophy, authors are asked to access the online submission system at: \r http://www.editorialmanager.com/opphil/\r Please choose as article type: Conceptual Personae.\r Before submission the authors should carefully read over the Instruction for Authors, available\rat: https://www.degruyter.com/publication/journal_key/OPPHIL/downloadAsset/OPPHIL_Instruction%20for%20Authors.pdf\r All contributions will undergo critical review before being accepted for publication.\r Further questions about this thematic issue can be addressed to Carlos A.

An interesting recent development in this area has been the application of text indexing and compression techniques to optimize graph queries at large scale. The tutorial will be divided into three parts. The first part will introduce and motivate graph databases in the broader context of data management, discussing their advantages (and disadvantages) compared with relational databases, their data models, their key applications, providing also a short demo of graph database engines in use. The second part of the tutorial will focus on querying graph databases, introducing the key primitives used for querying graphs, along with some popular graph query languages, before concluding with some high-level challenges for evaluating graph queries in an efficient manner. Towards addressing these challenges, the final part of the tutorial will introduce indexes and algorithms that enable the efficient evaluation of queries over graph databases, starting with more traditional techniques inspired by relational databases, progressing towards more modern algorithms and indexes; in this part, we will see some surprising applications of text compression and indexing techniques for querying graph databases efficiently (in terms of both time and space).
